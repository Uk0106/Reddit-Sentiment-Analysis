      "Happy Sunday /Anxiety! It's everyone's favorite day of the week... Sunday, the last 24 hours before Monday rears its head again. Let this thread be a space to set your intentions, share your goals and concerns, or just to check in, about the week ahead.-Hello everyone! Welcome to the Anxiety monthly check-in thread. We hope for this to serve as casual community chat for anyone who wants to get or stay involved without having to make a full post. You can also use this as an easy way to give us feedback on what you like and don't like about the subreddit.# Checking InLet us know what's on your mind! This includes (but is not limited to) any significant life changes/events that have happened recently; an improvement or decrease in your mental health; any upcoming plans that you're looking forward to (or dreading); issues you're dealing with in your own local or extended community; general sources of stress or frustration in your daily life; words of advice or comfort you want to share with everyone; questions/comments/concerns you want to share with the moderators and community regarding the subreddit.Thanks and stay safe,The Anxiety Mod Team-TW: self harmI’m 19 from Boston and just graduated high school last year. I never had a job in my life until last October, where I was extremely overwhelmed. It was a pet store, so I thought I’d love the job since I love animals but it actually made me extremely sad and stressed. I was the only person on the floor, the one other guy I worked with stayed in the break room slacking off. I was doing stocking, cleaning, customer service, phone calls, cashier, and feeding the animals that’s for sale. I had to deal with the broken cash registers that the managers refused to fix. I would constantly get yelled at from customers that I was taking too long checking them out, but in reality I was waiting for the stupid computer  register to reboot which took 2-5 minutes every other customer. I barely had any training, I was trained by the slacker guy who was new and didn’t know anything he was doing. Oh also on top of all of this, I had to start training people after a week and a half in. I didn’t even know what I was doing. I worked 5 days a week, 7 hours a day. I cried every morning on the way there, and at night I’d have painful panic attacks. Three weeks later, I felt so anxious that I just refused to go to work and blocked everyone I worked with on my phone. I freaked out so much and I started to S.H.  I felt like a baby, and my family thought I was stupid for quitting. I constantly get yelled at for being “lazy” for not having a job. I’ve called them out about this and they just said I’m making excuses. About a year later and I’m doing a vet assistant program at my local cc, but I still don’t have a job. It scares me so much to think about getting stressed like that again. I just wish I had a job thats not overwhelming like the one I had. I don’t want to get to the point where I start to S.H again because of a stressful job. I want a job more than anything right now. I want to feel independent but I can’t go through that again, having anxiety so bad that I feel like I’m dying.-Can I get a hug pls 🥺-Title basically.Sometimes I'll be so worried about everything I have to do that I can't do anything at all lmao.-Hi, Long story short, I received two job offers - one came the day before the other. I needed a job ASAP, so I accepted the first one straight away and my first day is on Wednesday. Today, I found out that I was offered another job and I am almost certain that I would prefer the second option over the first one. I don't know when my first day at the second job would be but I will attend my first day on Wednesday at the first job to get a feel of things. Maybe once I get to see how things actually are I will change my mind and decide I'm staying... Or maybe I will hate it so much that I'm going to have a hard time holding back tears? Now, if I do decide that I'm leaving, how do I tell my (scary as hell) manager that I don't want this job anymore? One part of me feels like I should just go with the first offer and decline the second one, but the other is telling me to go with whatever is going to make me happier. Why should I have to force myself to stay at a job that I hate and that makes me miserable, and decline a job that I've literally imagined myself in since I was a kid, just because I was too scared of the confrontation that would come with telling my manager about it? Should I just say something along the lines of 'I found a job that matches my areas of interest better' or 'Unfortunately, I don't think this job is the right fit for me and I'm not going to be able to perform to meet your standards', and apologise for wasting their time? If anyone has any advice, please let me know... I'm so stressed. Thanks in advance.-https://old.reddit.com/Anxiety/comments/p1zn7b/too_scared_to_get_vaccinated/I actually got my first vaccine this morning. I was meant to go to a doctor to just a chat over concerns. I told the doctor my concerns, then she had a chat with Mum and said it was better to get it over and done with today. It didn't really hurt and I feel OK afterwards.-I have suffered with stress and anxiety for the last 10 years. My head feels funny daily like woozy, lightheaded and what not feels like there’s a tight band around my head daily, temples, eyes and back of lower head. I am guessing it’s a mixture of both, i get tension headaches where they are that bad OTC don’t work especially back of my lower head/neck. Some days my head feels that off it makes me feel like i am drunk, when i close my eyes it feels like everything is spinning and can take 2 days to get over it. Hate these feelings i get but daily it’s like i feel it all constantly mildly. Like today i can feel the tight band and when i close my eyes it feels like things are spinning a little. I do believe it’s all to do with anxiety and stress because i have had it for all these years. I really want to how i can make my head feel normal again, i am starting meds and CBT soon. Any other advice? also the tension headaches i get that are really bad and painful are only now and then-If caffeine fuels anxiety, then what to do instead of it?-I fear stuff that I haven’t done before or don’t have a lot of experience in, no matter how small the matter may be, the mere unknown makes me so anxious. Ie Getting driver’s license, getting a credit card or paying bills and settling smt at the bank, or even just changing phones because I’m afraid my data will get lost or some stupid shit like that. At this point I’m beginning to think I’m just dumb, and it fuels my self hatred to the max-I had to cancel an appointment and the only way to cancel was by calling. I kept postponing for days but today was the last day to do it, so I just decided to bite the bullet and made the call. It made me terrified, but the actual call lasted for less than a minute. I feel so great since I have never been able to do this before. I hope you also do something that makes you proud of yourself today! <3-I’m 27 and I think about death and time on the daily. I’m afraid to go into my 30’s, 40’s, etc. due to the increasing amount of people we all inevitably lose over time the longer you live and I worry that this will actually crush me into a depression I can’t get out of.I also think about how you can lose anyone suddenly on a daily basis a lot. My brother just joined the Navy and will be stationed on a ballistic submarine for months at a time with no contact to the rest of the world. My sister was on the list for brain surgery as a toddler because she couldn’t stop having seizures and even 10 years later now we could still lose her to a seizure any day. I look at my parents and see the subtle changes of growing older of course and worry about their ailments. Who else feels these things on a daily basis? If so, what do you do to make light of it and move forward?-I’ve spoken to some amazing people here and it’s been a great support network.However I’ve realised that I’ve gotten everything I could get out of this experience and now it’s become overwhelming.My brain wants to soak up all of the information but is drawn to negativity.I need to leave to try and bring myself back to reality. The world isn’t as bad as my brain wants me to think.Big surgery coming up which has really been playing on my mind. Suicidal thoughts have been hitting me hard. I need to ground myself.I’m going to take some time off work and try to focus on more productive activities instead of social media which are a drain on me.I would like to thank all of you. I wish you all the best in life. Anxiety disorders truly are hell to deal with.This is my last day on Reddit then I’m signing off. I might revisit this in a few years time. I hope I make it out with a better life.Much love,RhysEDIT: 26/09/21 11:26pm UK time - I’m logging off Remember in a world this cruel, be kind ❤️-Hi everyone. I just wanted to share some of my troubles because I don't know what else to do anymore. In the last few years, I started noticing my avoidance of social events because I do not feel pretty enough. I follow my daily routine of having a shower, do my hair, makeup - everything seems just fine. I don't think there is objectively anything wrong with me but then within minutes when I start dressing up my brain just switches into \"You are ugly. You can't go anywhere looking like this\" mode and that's it. I start running from one mirror to another in my house. I start checking myself from each angle. I change my clothes 5 times and then decide anyway not to go anywhere. At that moment, I just see how none of my clothes fit me well, how horrible my hair look, my makeup is weird and most importantly - my whole body just looks crooked - my big cheeks and forehead, my weird looking posture, my fat arms, acne on my cheeks ... and I just don't feel comfortable with myself. Do you know the uncomfortable feeling when someone is standing behind you reeeaally close and you just can't focus on anything because of a fear that the person is judging you? That's how I feel - like if someone was standing really close behind me, every time I try to leave the house. If I eventually do leave the house, I have a feeling like everyone is watching me and I just don't have the right to be outside because I do not look a certain way and am just weird. I feel ashamed of myself.I know how irrational this might sound but right now I am sitting on my bed, after another crazy scene of running between mirrors, missing an important meeting, and not knowing what to do. Every day I think to myself - this is the last time I have done it. Tomorrow I will style myself better and everything will be fine. But what I am starting to realize is that no matter how I style my hair or how much I spend on my clothing, I will never get rid of that feeling of being ugly and not being able to leave the house. What am I supposed to do now? I went through many therapies and all I get are mixed diagnoses - PTSD, depression, anxiety, social anxiety, body dysmorphia - but nothing has ever helped me. Please, what can ease my life?-if i go to any big places like supermarkets, malls anywhere i aren’t used to going i start to feel lightheaded and a little woozy. Not to the point i am going to faint or fall I’ve but my head just feels weird. I’m guessing this is common with anxiety and stress. I feel like i deal with it daily but only mild and when i go to these big places or anything i feel it allot worse.-I started Lexapro yesterday. And I had the worst anxiety i’ve had in years. Shaking for more than 15 hours. Blood pressure very high, insomnia, headache, nausea, blood sugar very low, and dizziness. Also feeling everything unreal. My pulse wasn’t going down past 100. Today I took Clorazepate which helped me when I took it the day before Lexapro. Today I still feel nauseous, very very nervous and scared. Also dizzy.Has anybody had Lexapro before and had all of this? I only took one dose (one pill)-Hi. I'm not from the US, so I don't even go to \"college\", but  yeah...Anyway, my university gives students three opportunities to pass a class and I'm already in my second try. I study computer engineering. I just can't put myself to work due to anxiety and that makes me even more anxious because I'm going to get kicked out...My mother made a big effort to help me to buy my laptop to work and that makes me feel HORRIBLE because I would disappoint her so bad. I'm a mess right now. I just don't know how to calm down. Anxiety is ruining my life and I can't do much about it because my brain crushes me every time I try to help myself. What should I do. I have only two months and a half left.-Looking for some advice on how to let go of awkward/cringe moments! Anything helps :)-How do you all handle anxiety the night before a workday? My anxiety has gone up the roof, and I try to calm myself with some thoughts; but I feel like I’m really not doing well at work which causes my anxiety to shoot up during the weekends.-I feel nauseated every morning and go diarrhea like 4 times. I end up taking Zofran and Imodium but it isn't supposed to be taken every day.As soon as I wake up and my first anxious thought consumes me then boom I'm running to the bathroom.I have been living like this for many months now. GI doctor couldn't find anything wrong and literally before the end of our appointment said \"I don't know.\" I hate this. I have to wake up earlier than I should just to make time for this. I'm late to things when I don't.-So I moved out of state haven’t seen my grandparents in 2 years would regularly call them every other day it’s been a fantastic week catching up finally seeing each other and knowing despite them being really old are In amazing health but I’m starting to feel this deep dark depression knowing I’m leaving tonight back to my house like this sadness is overtaking me I know I’m gonna see them soon again and that they’re healthy but it’s like a homesick sad feeling I’m having seeing they’re home brought back so much memories and honestly I’m confused on what I’m doing living so far away from them states away to be exact….-*my doctor has told me I do not have sleep apnea*This has been happening to me for about a year and a half every single night, several times a night and I can not find ANY WAY to fix it and I need advice. I just want to sleep. Sometimes it just feels like a rush of extreme panic and fear and I shoot out of bed gasping for air, other times it feels like my throat is collapsing and I wake up choking, gasping for air and panicking. sometimes it feels like my heart stops and I wake up with a gasp. Most of the time it’s the throat collapse feeling accompanied by really bad panic. Does this happen to anyone else?? Any advice at all? I haven’t fallen asleep peacefully in over a year and I would do ANYTHING for one night of peaceful sleep… I know people that experience this every once in a while but I have never come across ANYONE that experiences it every single night multiple times before they can fall asleep. I can’t even find anything on the internet about this shit. I feel so alone about it….-My title says it all but for example: After I had breakfast today, washed the dishes and was kinda just chilling for a bit when I started feeling my heart beat faster and anxiety setting in my chest and bones. Im still feeling it. This happens randomly when Im just kinda relaxing and I don’t know if I’m weird or it’s natural.-Basically you stay up all night worrying about whether or not your gonna get into trouble the next day for not completing an assignment or homework for wherever reasons like let's say you werent in the previous lesson.And then you get to lesson and you find out either the teacher has set back the due date for the class giving you enough time to complete it (and you ask yourself what the hell was all that worrying about) or the teacher is not in and you have a substitute teacher and they dont ask about the homework or assignment that's due that day maybe because they didn't know or forgot and again you are relieved to have more time to complete the homework or assignment and wonder what all that stress and worry was about.-so i have to get the covid vaccine today in school. i do also have to get a flu nasal spray injection thing.and i’m SO ANXIOUS. i kinda feel like i can’t breathe and i’m so shakey. i can’t stop stressing out.pls can someone help reassure me or something? :(-I'm in my second week of taking Prozac and while I'm well aware that it will take at least a few more weeks till I actually feel any effects, I just feel way more anxious in general. Like even if I'm just overly excited I'm feeling anxious about being nauseous (I'm emetophobic, and it doesn't help it's also one of the side effects of the Prozac), and even a bit of nervousness will send me into a full-blown spiral and it just doesn't go away immediately until I take Xanax.I'm trying my absolute best not to reach for my benzos since I don't want to end up being dependent (or worse, addicted) on them, but ever since taking the Prozac it's gotten a lot easier for me to be on edge.-I have pretty severe social anxiety. But there are periods where I am Much better  in terms of the anxiety. I’m doing the same things and taking the same medication I have always. Not sure what it is that makes me feel awful most times but some times I have confident. I’m not doing anything different. It’s like the feeling of the honeymoon period on some psychiatric medications. That feeling, But I never started a new medication. Also is my anxiety in this case more mental or chemical imbalance based, in your opinion. Though Anyone else get this effect at times? As in anxiety fluctuating without a reason as to why.-I’ve been having increased anxiety the last few weeks, talked with my primary care dr, therapist and psychiatrist to get things sorted. They all keep asking me what comforts me/soothes me/gets the good feelings flowing. They always recommend exercise, which I know is important and does provide some relief, but when I’m too far into my anxious episodes it’s hard to make that a priority. What does everyone do to comfort them? Are there any activities that you enjoy or that you find helpful? Anything weird? Idc I’m just at a loss right now at what else I can incorporate to help prevent being more anxious. Please I’d love to know your recommendations whether it’s picking up your favorite coffee/going for a drive- literally anything I will try! I’d love to know what comforts and soothes others if you want to share/feel comfortable to share. Thank you in advance for reading and hope you are all doing well!! ❤️-When i am feeling off with it, i noticed when i feel bad because when i close my eyes my head feels like it’s spinning when it’s not. Not all the time most days i feel like i have allot of tension in my head specially lower head/neck. Which probably makes my head feel a little funny during the day. Also my head feels like it’s buzzing too.-Last night, I took 3mg of Xanax because it was the end of the work week for me as well as online exams🙌🏼Also, today around noon (it’s 11AM where I am) I have a dentist appointment so I thought taking something the night before might make me a little bit less anxious this morning. I was wondering how much Xanax should I take before my procedure today in order to calm me down completely?? And if so, should I tell my dentist beforehand that I took something? I do get Xanax prescribed to me for my GAD and insomnia. I always get SUPER nervous at the dentist, plus super shakey and stuttering my words so I know I’m gonna have to take something. Any advice is appreciated!👏🏻👏🏻-I had otitis media with effusion last month. It’s an ear problem. So far I don’t have it anymore. But I developed this anxiety to certain noises like sudden creaks on the floor, door bangs, scratching noises. Loud noises does not affect me. It’s only when it’s silent and I hear sudden sounds regardless of volume. It makes my brain jump. It’s like a startle response but mild. It annoys me.I don’t feel this way if i’m doing something. Or if im busy. Do you guys think i developed anxiety? I will be having my evaluation with a psychologist next week. And I don’t have an official diagnosis yet. It seems im anxious when there is no background noise. The initial burst of sound I hear “stings” my mind. It feels like it zaps my brain. But succeeding noises won’t bother me anymore. Weird. It’s only when it’s already silent for a few moments then when I hear a sound, it startles me…-Idk why these things give me anxiety but do u think the dentist would call if my appointment got canceled bc I didn’t do what I was supposed to before coming? 😥😥😥-Ugh I’ve struggled for so long with the same subject. Bats and rabies. About a month ago I was just stepping out of the car at night and something scratched my elbow. (I’m pretty sure I scratched myself on this sharp edge near my seatbelt). Anyways my mind says it’s a bat. Never saw one. But what if I didn’t look? I’ve been living in fear for a month now can’t get this off my mind. My parents laugh at me and everyone I say it to laughs at me. I’ve had this fear of bats for abt 6 months now. I just don’t know what to do. What if it was a bat? And what if it had rabies? My elbow had a TINY mark when I came inside with a TINY little mark of pealed skin. Took a shower then nothing was there. Just very worried-My neck/lower head always feels tense like there’s a band around it and my temples and eyes at times. Like a daily feeling but some days the tension gets too much and causes me bad pain after a few days it eventually goes. Probably why my head feels weird daily like, lightheaded and woozy at times.-I have pretty bad health anxiety lately.I was getting my blood pressure done, and it was pretty normal I think (121/83) but the pulse said “151” and I’m guessing that’s bpm?I thought that was crazy high. But I was having intense anxiety about the blood pressure thing for some reason. I felt my heart rate beating during this like it normally would during anxiety. I went home and downloaded an app to track my pulse, and it’s been normal since. Do you guys get very high heart rates during anxiety too? Have you ever tracked it? I’m thinking of getting a fit bit just to track my heart rate.-As the title says I think iv developed like anxiety around suicide as I took a antidepressant called prozac and 2 days in had suicidal thoughts every time I think about it I go mad in the past few days well I had a thought of hanging myself in my local woods (I'm no danger to myself I don't want to act on this and if I doi know who to call as deep down I love to live and dying is my worst fear) anyways this thought did scare the s**t outta me one night then every day after it was the same thought and I don't know if iv got depression now either but when I think oh idk if it can but prozac has given me chronic suicidal thoughts or I'm never gonna lose these or no  one can help me that last one sounds like depression but the thing is I'm not even diagnosed with depression and it all started after u took prozac that's y I'm so worked up about it the other thing is can anxiety make you like have thoughts over and over Thanks to anyone reading and sorry if it triggerd you-HelloI've always found myself paranoid about hearing noise from my neighbors. Anytime I hear a loud bang, or the slam of a door, or god forbid a dog, I can feel my blood pressure spike. I'll usually pause whatever I'm doing (TV, music, etc.) to try to figure out the source. I don't know why this bothers me so much, it's never constant noise -usually just a couple times a day- I try to reassure myself that everyone makes noises, that it doesn't impact my life in hardly any way, and that my life will be the same regardless of whether or not I hear my neighbors.I know I'm extremely sensitive to sound, but I can't live my life with noise canceling headphones on and constantly worried about my neighbors' noises. Recently I have moved to an end condo unit where the only shared-wall neighbor doesn't even live in the condo, just owns it and visits once every few years (according to the owners of MY condo). Well, after living here for 3 months I just saw them next door, and now of course I'm getting anxiety about all the what-if's. Biggest one being what if they're here to get their condo ready to rent it out, and the new tenants are loud and have a dog. I understand this is basic anxiety, and the what-ifs never help and there's no point. But all the reassurance in the world doesn't help me, nor does exposure therapy. The louder my neighbors have been in the past and the more I tried to expose myself to it to get used to it, the worse off my anxiety was. I'm just looking for some advice here on how to deal with these situations, thanks.-I (17M) was a “normal” kid 2 months ago. Now, im am riddled with panic and anxiety. This all started after my dog passed and things in my personal life went south abruptly. I had constant panic that was 24/7 for a solid week before I spent a week in a mental hospital. I was on lexapro for a while but it didn’t rly help me. When school started back I really had panic attacks again literally every second of everyday. I then switched to Zoloft and I felt so much better. I’ve been on Zoloft for about 3 weeks now I think and today is my first day that I haven’t felt my old self. I have some anxiety and a little panic but still 100x better than when this all first started. Has anyone experienced something like this where they went from being completely fine to having a life filled with nonstop panic and anxiety?-Hello guys, hope you are doing well.Last few weeks I basically live in the ER, almost every night I have a racing heart around 130-140BMP and higher blood pressure (around 145-155/90-95) I'm 29 years old man.My blood work and everything else is absolutely perfect.They told me it must be stress related and that I shouldn't worry about that blood pressure, that it is not constantly at that range, and that it's just a spike.Did you had anything like it, and do you think it's anxiety related, since it happens basically when I sleep and I don't feel \"panicky\", I just have racing heart and blood pressure and feel cold sometimes. Like really cold.Do you have some experience with that?I will take Xanax for 2 weeks now, hope it helps me sleep.-I’ve always been an anxious person, I’m currently taking Lexapro 20mg but some days it really feels like a pointless feat. Today I’m so anxious I feel sick & I want to cry. I’m working tonight & I really don’t think I have the strength to pull myself together & face the world. Some days I really wish I could just hide away but being an adult makes that quite impossible!-I've felt really depressed recently. I'm in a new city, remote working and my girlfriend is working shifts so she starts work as I finish. After work (WFH) I feel totally miserable and helpless but with a desire to be doing something but nothing feels appealing or interests me. I feel like I might be happier if I had friends in the area - currently I don't know anyone and it sucks I used to always hang out with friends at college/home. I have a bad relationship with my family otherwise I'd go see them more often.So I'm not sure which of these would be healthier?  I lean towards learning how to enjoy things on my own but this is really alien to me and I worry about the social isolation. Or trying to find a social hobby which feels daunting because I'm really bad at putting myself out there and honestly don't really have any hobbies. I tried DnD before really enjoyed it with my prior friends but doing it with strangers wasn't very enjoyable. I like gaming but I struggle to be into it now as much as I used to be. And I'm rubbish/self conscience about sports with strangers because I'm a very short (5'1) man and worry that can look odd and embarrassing. Any advice would be much appreciated.-So I’m typically the planner when it comes to vacations. I have an itinerary for our trips, and feel the need to always be doing something and get all the popular activities done. I worry that if we don’t accomplish something (i.e. visit specific scenic location) in particular on vacation that the vacation will be “less” in some way. Does anyone else get this way on vacations? Any suggestions for coping would be appreciated.-I constantly have this tight feeling in my chest and it feels as though this electricity is just continuously rushing from my head to my heart and back again. It’s really hard to explain; almost like an elephant is sitting on your chest. Do other people feel that? Same with constant intrusive, repetitive thoughts? I got off of my medication a year ago because I want to try to get through it without meds, but I am thinking it may be time to go back on them. 😞Thank you for any thoughts you can offer!-i’m fairly confused at why i always feel so shitty when i miss a dose (been prescribed 15mg 2x daily 10 months ago). i don’t get my ‘normal’ anxious feelings when i forget it (mostly gastrointestinal, shortness of breath, and blurred vision) i feel shakey and like something is wrong that i can’t pinpoint but then i take the pill and it goes away?? anyone else have a similar experience? do i have a mental addiction to the drug because i thought it wasn’t addicting?edit: forgot to mention my hands also get very sweaty when i don’t take it also-I am a Teenager who is attending school almost closing up on accouple of years of primary school before college. Somedays I feel alone and sadden because in my head I feel like I get constantly pressed by a anxious demon controlling the steering wheel this demon in my head makes me think so much about life, health, my heart rate, my cognitive problems, friends, and me. It almost never stops it keeps on going.   Somedays I feel very sad to the point where I question myself why am I still continuing, running, why am I here? It was hard trying to find out what I had at first because Doctors, Teachers, and more didn't believe me that I was having a serious problem. It gotten bad because I was left to research for myself, no resources, no starting point, just googling constantly until I found what I have had. For the past accouple of months I have had to deal with constant threats from a student to my friend who I cared about, this student yelled at me and my friend, caused fights, yelling, screaming, eventually administration got involved, they haven't suspended the student or withdrew the student from the school for a good 3 months. And keep in mind this was happening in all 3 of my classes that I had this student at. I felt horrible, felt scared about going to school, shaken, and I have also had more stressful moments throughout my school life as well.   I cry sometimes in my sleep because of these thoughts and countless thoughts about my health such as (do I have a panic disorder, do I have OCD, do I still have depression, will I ever be free)..? I worry about these thoughts almost all the time, I tried getting help from my Doctor but he didn't really think that I had Depression. So instead I was left to fend for myself.I just want to talk to my family normal again, talk to my friends again, not be scared constantly, or doing something fun again. I don't want my anxiety to hold me back I want to live, I want to be free from this anxiety demon.  I want to play, I want to Drive, I want to have a Job. I want to have my memory back. I just want someone to believe me, I want to be loved.. There are so many I want statements that I can't fit in this paragraph but you get the idea.   Somedays I feel like nobody is there like I am just invisible only used for an academic scores on a statewide test. Somedays I feel like I am an invisible void in the earth.    I just got to keep my head up though... Someday I hope that I can be free from this demon, learn to control it from interfering from my life, I am already receiving group therapy treatment from a Mental Health Counselor, hope it helps.-Today has not been off to a good start for me. I woke up with what I think is anxiety.. internal shakiness and my heart pounding and not being able to get back to sleep before my alarm. I had some blood work done this morning because my doc wants to make sure I’m not lacking something before he throws me on medication for anxiety.. but I am pretty positive I am good. My grandma, mom and sister all have anxiety so it’s inevitable that I do too. I’ve been struggling with some type of dissociation/depersonalization/derealization but I don’t know what the difference is between them. I feel like I’m looking through a mask and that I’m not really here. It’s so hard to explain. I have been struggling with eye floaters and it’s crazy because I got them two years ago and learned to ignore them and now they are back and feel worse than ever. Whoever says that anxiety can’t make them worse is lying I swear. Anyways.. that’s just me ranting for the day.. thanks for reading. If you have any advice on learning to cope with anything please let me know.. I can’t see a therapist until November 23 (military mental health sucks)-i’ve just been so mentally exhausted lately and just feel so defeated sometimes and just wonder when this low point is gonna get better. it’s been so hard and i try so many things to help it and none of them have been working cause that’s how bad it’s been. talking to people and listening to people is what helps me most, so feel free to share anything you want to share. i have hope for us all🤍-nan-Last night, I was almost hit by a driver from behind. I was slowing to turn, but they were going at full speed (35 - 40 mph). Came within a couple feet of hitting the back of me, but avoided me by passing in the turn lane. It gave me flashbacks to an accident I was involved with in 2020, where I was at a full stop, but a texting driver smashed the back of my car going ~40 mph. Since last night, I've been very stressed, angry, and depressed. I imagine the feelings will pass, but I just felt the need to vent about it.-take ADHD meds.\"“Individuals with social phobia make too much serotonin. The more serotonin they produce, the more anxious they are in social situations. Previous studies have led researchers to believe that individuals with social anxiety disorde social phobia have too low levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin.”SSRI and serotonin is actually the culprit behind anxiety, if you want 0 anxiety, take amphetamine or methylphenidate (aka. dopamine), I took it and I talk like an alpha male irl and don't give a single fuck. Dopamine is good, serotonin is bad (at least in this situation). I find it extremely idiotic that doctors prescribe serotonin drugs for fucking anxiety? And blame dopamine on being the cause of anxiety, a bunch of idiots.Also, being jittery is not anxiety, yes these drugs may cause you to stutter and become jittery, that's from the effect of norepinephrine, but they are not anxiety, people often confuse that for anxiety.Also make sure to choose the med with more dextroamph (high dopamine ratio, low norepinenphrine ratio).It's pathetic how I was diagnosed schizophrenia and I took this drug and now I feel normal? no negative thoughts, no anxious thoughts, no stress, no paranoid, no delusions, none.-Hi. Just wondering about how people found starting on Zoloft?I’m on day five and can already feel a difference with my anxiety. However I’m exhausted, I fell asleep sitting up the other night minutes after feeling slightly tired?Just curious if this happened anyone else in the beginning and how long it took to regulate for you?-let me preface this by saying that i know that i am fortunate. the pandemic has let me keep my health and no one around me has gotten sick or died, at least from covid. i have shelter and food and have a future. but still - the pandemic took away my hopes and dreams and any self esteem i had left. before - i had just been laid off, skipped the meager unemployment check because i thought i’d find a job quickly enough; two years later, my savings are wiped out and i’m 35, single, and completely dependent on my aging parents. there has been no aspect of my life unaffected by these realities. i went, in the course of less than a year,  from buying lululemon yoga pants to wondering how i was going to make canned tuna and frozen peas into an acceptable dinner. it was a shell shock. my support system? i can’t relate to them anymore. my friends are having babies, making over $70k, and nearly  all moved away during covid. my relationship with my parents is strained with the financial burden i am to them now. they are both estranged from extended family, so they don’t have support either. this past summer, my longtime best friend asked me to come nanny for her children in florida - the dynamic of being her employee nearly ruined our relationship and we aren’t currently speaking. (i also broke even on money as i had to pay my airfare and for food.) my closest friend who still lives in the same town was recently diagnosed with terminal brain cancer at the ripe young age of thirty and i feel guilty for ever being sad about my own situation — and terrified of losing her. health-wise, i don’t feel like myself anymore. i had a year and a half of various anxiety medications in which i gained 40 lbs and finally stopped them because i couldn’t take what they did to my body. my mom constantly bullies me about my size now despite knowing it wasn’t due to too many cheeseburgers. i haven’t lost the weight yet - and men who previously flirted and asked me out on a regular basis have gone radio silent. i’m too anxious to even try dating again. my exes are doing well - one has a local business i have to watch boom in real time. i do yoga almost every day and i think it’s the only thing i feel proud of. i’ve applied to and interviewed for every job that makes sense for my previous sales skill, though i don’t want to stay in sales. i’ve tried coffee shops and retail. i’ve been told i’m over and under qualified. i’ve thrown hail marys and asked strangers on linkedin for opportunities. nothing doing. needless to say, i’m hopeless. i can’t afford counseling. i don’t want another round of meds to gain even more weight. i can’t see a way forward. what else is there to do?-Recently work has been getting me down because of a few reasons. Basically I’ve struggled with it mentally. Then one morning as I was getting ready I just couldn’t physically go in. It’s hard to explain but I just couldn’t drag myself in. When I didn’t go in the anxiety only got worse as I’ve had quite a bit of time off recently and I felt so guilty and worried about my career. I mean I hate work some times I find it so difficult to cope with at times. Other times i enjoy it. I am embarrased by the amount of time off I’ve had to have recently. Anyone else the same?-Hello! Me again.. With yet another fear.  First, I just want to ask, vaccinated or not, how common is tetanus? How common is the bacteria that causes it?I had all my shots as a kid, and even though I dont remember, my mom assured me I had a booster at 16. Now, you're supposed to get boosters every 10 years, but now I'm 27, so 11 years have passed, and I got a small cut with the rustiest, most rotten and dirty metal I could find.. I got the booster less than 48 hours after the cut, but now I'm worried it wasn't quick enough, or that I was exposed some time earlier and ddnt notice.My inner ears feel tense and clogged, my neck feels too tense on the front, as if i pulled a muscle, and my cheeks feel kinda tense, tired. I'm panicking, freaking out, you name it.. &#x200B;I don't know anyone who's ever had tetanus, never heard a singe story for it. All i know is, it has no cure and can be potentially fatal. I don't know what to do. I have bruxism, which means i grind my teeth constantly due to stress, so that doesnt help, since i feel tension on my jaw anyways... I need help, advice, reassurance, anything helps.Thank you!-Last week I migrated from my home country to Germany to study and the last days have been horrible. I felt really stressed before leaving and after arriving and now I suffer daily from nausea, exhaustion for no reason and dizziness. My mood is also bad because of this, or it could be this that causes the symptoms idk. Last year was also difficult for me as I went a lot of stress, panick attacks, and  other stress symptoms and I thought I overcame them but I was wrong.I'm afraid that if I stay here that will ruin my quality of life and my student life. But on the other hand if I leave I'm afraid I will regret it because I really want to study in this beautiful country. What should I do? How can I make this transition less stressful and get my life back on track and how will I know if this difficult period is temporary or not?-You hear about all these motivational speakers saying turn off your emotions that seems to be a lot easier said than done. Where is the fine line that I can follow to have both emotions but no to much. Background i have ADHD +OCD+Dyslexia The trifecta of mental stability 😵‍💫.-I have ptsd and persistent anxiety, like gad. I have had 2 panic attacks with dissociation. I think i have ocd too, i can’t stop looking up symptoms because i fear i might have something chronic like bpd, even tho i don’t meet the criteria. I feel anxious interacting with family and everyone. I isolate myself and stop working because anxiety and feeling on edge. Distractibility. I think i might have more than one anxiety disorder.-?? Does anyone else experience this. I’m going on a flight next month it’s quite long a whole day of flying with 1 stop over. Is flying with vertigo safe ?? Do I just take normal anti sickness / motion sickness tablets-nan-I feel very anxious about starting this job. Do you people have any advice for me? The racing thoughts come in waves just thinking about starting.-im 22 and I want to put myself out there, I was ready until I had a mental breakdown and ghosted everyone for 3months. I’m back to talking to everyone again but I’m still keeping my distance.Ive been like this since highschool except I really didnt want to speak to anyone so I didnt, I started to hang with the quiet group bc they left me alone and didnt expect me to talk. My therapist thinks I have ptsd from childhood sexual abuse but no diagnosis bc she said she’s not qualified. Im doing much better than highschool but still feel afraid of being noticed. I can finally socialise again but sometimes I have phases or I get triggered.I go to university tomorrow and anxious to put myself out there and be noticed. I just dont want to be noticed but at the same time im not having fun living my life like this. I just want to enjoy my life without having to feel hyper vigilant all the time. Im not feeling good rn. My weight is low as well. Do you have any tips for me?-Living in Florida and Texas for over 2 decades, I've had run-ins with multiple pests (silverfish, springtails, german roaches, book lice, millipedes, carpet beetles, weevils, and ants.) I also move around a lot for work and I've gotten into the habit of taking some precautions when moving from home to home. I get severe anxiety now dealing with pests and take major precautions to ensure I saw as few bugs as possible. I always rent a 2nd story condo/room or higher. I've learned my lesson with ground floors. I've had good results with Cimexa Dust and have started dusting all baseboards, cabinets, outlets, carpets and window sills throughout the entire home. I use a dehumidifier in the bedroom and bathroom to keep humidity in the 30's or 40's using a meter to monitor. I caulk all outlets, crevices, and recessed lighting where I can. The bedrooms are usually carpeted and I can't seal the baseboards and carpet with caulk. So once I dust, I'll seal around the room using white duct tape to prevent the dust from being disturbed and pests crawling in. I always keep food in airtight containers and don't really keep grains in the home. I never leave dishes in the sink and clean out the microwave/oven at least once a month. I also vaccumm the home weekly. I know bugs will always inevitably find a way in but I've found these help in limiting any possible infestations that might occur. Any time I see a bug in my house I get obsessive and start searching with a flashlight for more. I found a baby silverfish inside a paper Trader Joe's bag I had just brought home and now refuse to bring any amazon boxes or cardboard into the condo. One of our neighbors brought in grain weevils that got pretty bad and spread into our unit and there was nothing we could do while they tried to fix it.I find it hard to focus on any other aspects of life, work, family, and friends. I'm moving about an hr away for a new job and starting to freak out that this new townhome will be riddled with pests as well.-Hi , so as I already explained in my title, I have horrible anxiety when leaving from my home with the car (with planes, or any other transportation methods as well).I am building anxiety before leaving home, and than there I just wait for the trigger to happened and get the panic attack, or if I do not have a PA I just get random dizziness, sickness, chest pain and a general state of sick. If you have some tips or tricks for me, I will happily read them and put them in practice, I am just too tired of anxiety.-In early August my neighbor's tree fell on my car, the damage was pretty bad but my insurance didn't total it immediately. Fast forward 4 weeks, my agent finally gets the estimate from the shop, my car was totaled. Due to getting the coverage we could afford we did but get rental coverage, so I've been borrowing vehicles from my family. Now 6 weeks on since I started my claim I've still gotten no check in the mail, stressor number one. Stressor number two is my wife's vehicle, a 20 year old blazer, the very same day my car was officially totaled her blazer died, leaving us with no vehicle and needing at best an engine replacement, but not solving some other outstanding issues with her ride. We're now struggling to accommodate two different work schedules and a toddler on a single borrowed monte Carlo with high mileage and bad seals. I feel like I'm drowning, like I can't catch my breath anymore. Money was tight when we had two working cars, it's getting worse. I know I have to survive for my family, but I feel like I'm not going to. I just want to give up, because I feel like such a failure, that even getting to and from work is such a struggle. I'm scared I'll lose my house, my job, and more if I can't find a way to turn things around. I'm so used to having a strong support system in my family, but as with most people they're dealing with their own problems and in no place to help me more than they have, not that I can bring myself to ask for more. I'm not the only one here that feels like their lives are crumbling, but I need a break so bad. All things considered my problems aren't that bad, money is tight and we're down both of our cars in a part of the world that doesn't fund public transit, all pretty minor stuff, but I can't get past it this time.-I used to have anxiety 3 years ago but it went away and i have not had it since but about a week and a half ago my stomach really hurt and i felt like i needed to throw up but couldn’t and i thought this was just a stomach bug but it’s been over a week and i still feel like this daily and more recently started feeling dizzy like i am gonna fall over and like there’s a big air bubble in my stomach i have missed a lot of school and got behind. i went to the doctors they checked my blood pressure, heart rate and breathing and it all showed up as normal but i’m scared i am sick with something that they haven’t checked for yet like maybe a deficiency of some sort. i really hope this can stop happening.-Hey guys I have two part time jobs that add up to around 30 hours a week and I am constantly overwhelmed. It’s a lot for me even doing that much and sitting in a computer chair just staring at a screen all day. My manager recently asked if I want more hours and while I should be hopping at the chance to make more money, I desperately want to tell her no but I am conflicted because I feel guilty since it’s more money and it’s not like I’m doing anything super productive outside of work. I just feel so anxious about what to do. I hate that 40 has to be the norm. And some people probably don’t even think that’s much. Our culture is so obsessed with work and money. I just want to work to pay the bills and a bit extra so I’m comfortable because to me time is just as valuable. Time to unwind and live how I want to.-TW as well for eating disorder-adjacent stuff. Sorry for the giant post.So my anxiety has gotten incredibly bad lately. I'm diagnosed and treated for OCD and ADHD, so even with medication, my baseline for anxiety is like a four out of ten on my best day, but I've been at like a constant eight with spikes to 9 or 10.A lot has gone on. I'm in grad school full time, and I found out from my job that, despite agreeing to let me go part time to work on this degree, they want me to go back to full time or replace me. I know a lot of people work full time and go to school full time, but I'm just not strong / organized enough to be able to pull that off.I suspect that part of the anxiety spike is perimenopause or thyroid issues that tend to crop up around my age in XX chromosome possessors, but I've got a bit longer before I can get in to see a GP.My spouse has some untreated anxiety stuff, and I feel so awful for him. I feel like I'm too weak to be supportive, and honestly, his self-loathing / rejection sensitivity is a huge trigger for me. I was taking Xanax for anxiety attacks, but it was doing very little for me, so my provider has switched me to Valium until the mood stabilizer she's provided kicks in.The valium has helped some. I'm still having trickle eating, and an anxiety attack can have me losing everything in my stomach with great speed and force. I'm so scared that the mood stabilizer isn't going to work. I'm so scared that I'm going to fall apart. I'm so scared that my spouse is never going to find any peace and I don't know how to help.Sitting here at work feeling lightheaded and cold and just wishing that I wasn't like this.-Anytime someone say just a slightly critical thing about me I just break down. I don't know why am I that sensitive but, it just ruins my whole life.Like, my whole day had been great, then someone make a comment about my appearance and it's ruined.  Anyone else felt like that before?I just want to pause and cry it all out, but I can't since I'm in school.-I’m going to go have my blood pressure checked just to see if everything is good. It’s been years since I’ve done this so I’m hoping everything is normal and could ease my health anxiety a bit.I know we could feel our pulse and calculate the number of beats in 10 seconds and then times it by 6 to know what our heart beat per min is. This has been helpful for me. Is there any other helpful ways you could remind yourself that you are okay? Ways you could check if things are working properly when your intrusive thoughts are telling you they’re not? My health anxiety sucks lately. Every little change my body goes through, or little symptom I have, makes methink of the worst. I try not to bug my doctor when it’s likely my anxiety. But ways to reassure myself at home that I’m okay would be very helpful.-So ill start off by saying that I suffer from panic disordered. I was taking doxpine for my panic attacks and sleeping, which is did help really well. But due to the side effects of it I wanted to switch. The main said effect that made me switch from doxpine was the bleeding gums. I would wake up and have pretty much a cup of old blood in my mouth. Sorry for that image but it shows you why I switched. So I weened off doxpine slowly. After stopping I waited 3 days before I started taking the prozac. So I have been taking it for like 3 days now. I take it at 830 at night. The 1st night I took it I had a panic attack which I'm guessing is normal. But I haven not missed a dose, my anxity and panic are definitely up more than they where. I'm just trying to manage to get through this time. I'm trying to eat as much as can I even though I don't have the urge to eat. I guess I just want to know this all this is normal. Like my hands and feet and sweaty. When I have a panic attack I assume the worse (heart attack). I'm just hopefully that this only last for two weeks. For ever who reads this thank you and if your going through the same thing know your now alone.-I can't explain the feeling I just feel so anxious and the vibes just feel so wrong I hate that word I mean the atmosphere feels so wrong in some places I am in, for example I hate big cities they make me feel so weird and like pubs ( in the UK ) I hate they make me feel so weird, but I love places like the library and I love some hotel lobbies for some reason and I love old styles places and castles but I hate hate hate places like train stations and stuff idk some places just make me feel so so weird like I almost cried cus I was in a city late at night with family and I just felt so like uncomfortable-Hi, so I finally decided that there's no way imma get through the next few months in the state I'm in, so I got a doctor's appointment for later today to get some help.Anywayy, I have no idea what to say when I go in. Like \"what can I do for you today?\" Err, idk bro, I'm stressed af, having anxiety attacks, can't relax at all, constantly feel on edge about deadlines/my future/dumb shit I cant get out of my mind.My mum said that I shouldn't down play my symptoms cuz therapists r in short supply atm but that made me feel like a fucking impostor. I really just need help w the first sentence to say, how do I start talking?Edit: thanks for everyone's help, it went well in the end, she listened to me n it wasnt too stressful.She ended up prescribing me sipralexa (escitalopram) and gave me the number of some doctor friend of hers who does guided meditation stuff, idk, sounds interesting.-I literally find something to be anxious about 24/7. Even when there’s absolutely nothing to be anxious about I create something in my head. It’s driving me crazy and idk what to do. I have a therapist and take antidepressants and it still keeps happening.-This may or may not be anxiety related but there was something I noticed about people yesterday and it’s causing me not to sleep. So yesterday, I went out shopping like I normal do every month with my mom and I noticed a few people who were doing strange things. It started out with people just standing in the way or for instance if you’re trying to walk down the aisle at the grocery store, some random person will just walk up and stop in your way. This happened to me at least a dozen of time until I became frustrated and gather what I needed and left. But I did notice that there was a lot of people just stopping and staring at nothing. When I got to the check out line, there was a man who just stood there as if he was day dreaming and would not move. I don’t know if I was “lagging” or if the guy wasn’t paying attention but he just stood there and the cashier didn’t say anything. After two minutes I guess he woke up and moved up to check out. I was next and I place my items and I saw this lady behind me doing the same thing. She was a good 20 feet behind me and she just stood there didn’t move. I assume it was because of “covid” and she was keeping distance but my things were already bagged and there was room on the conveyor belt for her to set her items down. She did not move and she also stood there for 5 minutes just staring at nothing. I shook it off and headed out the door with my mom and child, but he wanted a sandwich so I got him food. We loaded up the car and then we headed out of the parking lot. As we pull up to the light, I notice the same woman who was behind me standing at the cross walk on the other side of the street, but she was just standing there on the curb. It wasn’t a bus stop, no sign she was reading; just an vacant lot with tall grass and debris.  She stood there at the middle of the cross walk not movie at all. No cars blew at her or stopped she just stood there. (She was already on the other side of the street but she was just standing at the curb). Before anyone assume, I did think she was waiting for a ride. The only thing that made me realize she wasn’t was the simple fact her back was turned away from the streets and she just stood there as if she was walking frozen in time. She was standing as if she was about to complete her walk but she was paused. We headed to a different store to shop for food and I noticed the same thing happening again this time at the produce section of the store. It was people just standing there. This started to remind me of a movie. No one was moving for a while and then it was like someone hit the play button. I got my things and got the hell out. I get home and as I was putting up the food, I turned to my mom to ask her a question and she was just standing there like she was in a trance like state. And I asked if she’s ok. She goes “yea what’s wrong with you”. And I’m like but you were just standing there staring at the floor. She goes “No I wasn’t “ and I just side eye her.Am I tripping or is there something more going on that I don’t know about. I don’t want to sound like I’m paranoid. But yesterday was very strange to me. Has this happen with anyone else?-It's been around 3 or 4 years since I cannot leave my house due to anxiety anymore. I always kinda disliked being outside for too long (loved it when little tho), but it suddenly got worse one day. Couldn't go to school anymore because each day in the morning I'd get extrem nauseous and have a lowkey panic attack. Also didn't help that I barely slept and was struggling with insomnia (still am and my sleep schedule is horrible. I've been told fixing it would ease my morning sickness but it's hard to ne consistent).I went to therapy, got medication and things got better for a while, but I stopped that after I graduated because that was literally the only reason I wanted to go to therapy - to be able to graduate. Also some appointments got forgotten so I didn't bother making new ones anymore and got off medication as well. I was doing okay. Antidepressants made me a functioning human being, yet I don't want to have to keep being dependent on them. Also side effects. Not fun. (Should I tho if they were helping me so much?) Now after covid happening and staying home almost constantly for like 2 years, also online university, have made it a little bit too comfortable for me again. I noticed whenever I leave the house I literally want to throw up. I just feel so nauseous, my stomach cramps and I feel dizzy. It's even far worse than 3 years ago. I tried taking my prescribed xans from back then but I dislike xanax and I'd rather not take them (making me even more tired than already, weird feeling even at lowest dose, hangovers).So I'm here to ask if anyone has similar experiences, fears going outside ans what I can do about it. Also any ideas why that is even happening in the first place? Maybe anxious about leaving my safe space? Idk what to do. Soon university isn't online anymore and I'm scared I won't be able to attend due to this painful anxiety. I just wanna be a functioning human being. Thanks in advance(I also posted this in another sub, I hope that's okay)-I get these little head taps when trying to sleep and sometimes when i try go back to sleep after waking up in the middle of the night. My anxiety has been waking me up recently. It’s weird because it feels like i am seeing flashes occasionally but not at the same time it could be just my anxiety playing tricks on me and when i try go back to sleep I’ll get random thoughts that don’t make sense like i get this one thought of me turning off a switch and when i did that it woke me up with a jolt. It’s hard to say if i am seeing flashes or not or it’s just my anxiety. Sometimes i wake up in middle of the night and just turn over and my heart just starts beating out of my chest for no reason.-I (16m) am having my first job interview tomorrow and am really nervous. I struggle with social anxiety and was wondering if anyone here has any tips when it comes to the interview as to how to calm myself down. Thanks-So in Victoria , Australia, we’re still in lock down and have been 200 days now.My biggest anxiety isn’t getting COVID, but it’s realising that when everything opens up again that I’ll probably still be at home on the weekends and everyone else will be out and about with their other group of friends It’s very daunting to me and as much as I hate not being able to go out , I also feel safe knowing that EVERYONE is at home not doing anything and I’m not suffering from major FMOPlease tell me if anyone else feels or felt this way?-I was accepted to an internship and I start tomorrow. I am so anxious I can’t sleep. I have to be up early, and there’s still so many things I have to do. It’s 2 am and I’m still up.I am so incredibly nervous. I feel like I’m gonna screw this up somehow.-A few days ago, my anxiety got the best of me and I went off on a friend while I was trying to conceal that I was having an attack. It made a bit of a scene and led to all the people we were hanging out with leaving.Tonight I did the same thing. I was with the same group, and was getting completely ignored. Everytime I talked no one listened, or I was talked over. Even if it wasn’t intentional, it made me feel super shit about myself and I began to have a bit of an anxiety attack. I was trying my best to conceal it and was doing a pretty good job at it too. I don’t know why I even entered this situation in the first place, I had a gut feeling it would end like this. I felt like I was super fucking alone and didn’t want to leave because I was too scared they’d talk about me behind my back. I waited a solid 5 minutes trying to get a friend’s attention which just enhanced my anxiety and made me feel even shittier. As some of my friends motioned to leave, I got up to go with them, but they proceeded to sit back down, leaving me at the door. I then got ready to leave, but asked them if they were going to which apparently was a major fuck up. They just looked at me and got pissed and then I went off. All my bottled up anxiety came out and I hate myself for it. The friends I was with left with me and told me that I can’t keep doing this, but I don’t know how to stop this. I left them and know they went back to the group and talked about me for an hour straight.I fucking hate myself for this right now. Just needed to rant and get this off my chest. I don’t know what to do anymore, this shit just keeps getting worse and worse and worse for me.I’ve realized now too that I smoked the same shit on both of these nights. The first incident was the first time, the second time was last night where I almost had a panic attack but stopped it, the third time was tonight. I’m extraordinarily pissed at myself for not realizing this sooner, and even angrier that I didn’t know that certain types of weed can enhance your anxiety. I’m sorry for anyone who read all of this, I need to get this off of my chest, I hate this so much and it’s having such a god awful effect on my relationships. I burned a lot of bridges tonight and can’t keep this from happening. I don’t know what to do anymore man, I just don’t know what to do anymore.-When I am anxious it’s very hard to tell if I’m feeling nauseous and feeling like throwing up because I really got sick( like a bug, Stomach flu, food poisoning)  or if it’s anxiety/IBS. Do you know how to tell the difference ? How?-nan-I'vee always been very skeptical about this alien stuff but my anxiety made me fear being abducted by a thing i dont even quite believe exists. Anyone also has this fear??-I try to intentionally make myself feel bad for random shit by telling myself that I don’t feel bad that will mean I’m a bad person. Recently, my teacher acknowledged me by saying ‘ so you are back’ in a mocking tone, since I always avoid answering in class either by skipping it or leaving the meeting. At first, I didn’t feel any shit , I was like whatever. Suddenly, Idk from where, this stupid ass voice kept on telling me why I should feel bad? It was really overwhelming. I wasn’t able to stop. I feel like I am being dramatic af and trying to pity myself. I’m not able to stop myself. Idk how to deal with it. These thoughts don’t even stop, I am not even kidding I feel I am going crazy. I don’t want to tell this to friends and parents but they either brush it off and tell me just to stop thinking. Sometimes I just want a car to hit me so it can be stopped.Sorry for my English.-I’m in armenia for my student visa because my country is fucked. And I’m having to start my classes online. I can’t switch on my camera but it’s a must. I feel like I can’t function without my pills(I’m not dependent on them I just wish I could have them when I get a panic attack). Do I go see a psychiatrist here or should I just deal with it?-So I’m an extremely paranoid person , I got this scared right after watching some tiktok videos about how some girls had regular heavy bleeding but still turned out pregnant even without knowing. Apparently it’s called cryptic pregnancy.I just got sexually active early this year to my long term boyfriend. In terms of my periods , it can be irregular and light at times but other times it will come out fine. So my first scare was at the end of February when I lost my virginity to him and he came inside when I said no. This was feb 26th and it’s stupid I know and I took the plan b right after which was within 4 hours and we broke up. I was extremely paranoid but ended up getting my periods and everything was fine. Periods were regular. Took too many tests all came out fine. I didn’t have sex again until the 25th may with a current guy who I’ve been seeing since early April. He made sure I was comfortable and pulled out. I got my period the following month as well but it felt sorta light , so 2 weeks after I took a pregnancy test and it showed I wasn’t pregnant(this was June). However the month of July I didn’t get my period at all and this time took another test and still I wasn’t pregnant and also 25th may was the last time I had sex. Wayy too paranoid after that. So August I got my period TWICE which was the first week on of the month and it still felt light but then 3 and half weeks later I got my period again on the last 7 days of august and this time it was heavy which I felt relieved. (Maybe my July period was a week late hence why I had two periods in august ?)Btw I’ve had irregular, light and heavy cycles before so it’s not that new but this new fear sucks. I’m due my next period any day now.  Like I said I haven’t had sex since may 25th It’s been ages so idk why I’m worried, these stories I’m seeing on tiktok is making me paranoid, I’m a petite frame but early this year my stomach did gain a bit (before I lost my virginity Btw) so sometimes I think what if it’s not fat but something in me and I just don’t know about it. I’m scared if it’s from may 25th I would be 15 weeks without knowing. And if the time I lost it at feb I would be 28 weeks without knowing. I’m seeing my doctor in 2 weeks when face to face dr appointments start again for the pill(country in lockdown). Please don’t judge me i know it was stupid to have unprotected sex twice, I should have learnt after the first scare. I’m not planning on have sex again until I get on the pill or even at all tbh.Edit: got slight period like cramping and very lightly bleeding but not a full on period yet. I’m scared I’m hoping its a period-I feel like 90 percent of the time, I’m worrying about something— something I said, did, the future, etc. My stomach always feels like it’s in knots and I’m never not overthinking. For example: just this past weekend, I hung out with a friend I hardly ever see. Her birthday is this week and I got her a gift (nothing much, just a fall candle and a t-shirt that reminded me of her that I thought was cute) and I can’t help but think it was dumb and I shouldn’t have given it to her. I keep on thinking that she probably doesn’t like it or I should’ve done something else. This is a perfect example of me worrying over nothing. I feel like the constant worry is ruining my life. My nerves are shot, I’m constantly worried about what others think and my appearance so I’m constantly down on myself. I can’t fall asleep at night and I’m having so much trouble focusing at work and on daily tasks. I procrastinate and I feel unaccomplished most of the time. I have had no desire to do much of anything lately, but I know for a fact that I need to get myself help.-Me (F28), him (M29).Tl;dr Can deep fear of loss cause us to lose attraction to our partner, feelings of being in love, etc., even cause aversion or repulsion? And can it be remedied, healed, and can your feelings return?I experienced going from \"in love\" to repulsion and an inability to even be around him as I deal with deep, old trauma.Thankyou for any insight🙏-So, It’s been 6 months since I had a bad episode. And this past week has been the best week ever.  I did not experienced anxiety at all and was almost believing that I won my fight. And today while watching an episode of my favorite show. I felt like a stab on my chest and my heart just wen crazy beating supper fast and I lost it. I went into panic mode and thought I was dying. Scared my DH and told him to call 911. Now I feel super guilty for putting my family through this drama. On the other side I am happy that I am not dying.-I have my papsmear tomorrow as well as the results to my bloodwork to check my hormones. Scared sh*tless that my pap is going to come back abnorm after having an irregular period out of nowhere last month (brown spotted for 7 days and bled moderately for 13 days). Thankfully my period was normal this month, but my health anxiety keeps telling me I'll have an abnormal smear (6 years past due) and have precancerous cells or cervical cancer. Ugh, I hate this. My health anxiety is through the roof. :(-I just need to get some thoughts out. To preface, I’m not saying these things with anger or because I want people to feel bad. These are just thoughts I’ve been having lately while going on my anxiety journey:Anxiety is extremely hard to battle. Almost every day is mentally rough. The negative, sometimes suicidal, what-if, and self-harm thoughts are sometimes relentless. The suffering in silence makes me feel unworthy of love, grace, support, and care, because sometimes I choose to do so. Not all the time, but sometimes. The fake smiling, joking, and laughing are things that I do to hide my anxiety because I wish people understood, but they don’t so I shouldn’t talk about it. The pressure of trying to be perfect is exhausting some days, both mentally and physically. Yet I hide my anxiety due to fear of becoming vulnerable, and possibly being judged.I don’t like feeling like everyone is constantly judging me, or that I worry that I’ll do something stupid in front of people. Panic attacks make me feel like I don’t deserve love. Anxiety is not just worrying. It is so much more.-I have been having spasms in my eye constantly and tremors in my hand for quite some time. Did some research and came to the conclusion that It can happen due to normal stress. But I'm worried. I feel a lot of tightness in my neck usually. Dealing with heart palpitations as well(though it's not severe imo). Anybody else who might have faced the same. How did you work around this?-I had gynecomastia surgery about a month and half ago. And they say it takes 3 months to see final results. But I overlook myself in the mirror and it doesn’t look appealing, I constantly think of the worst outcomes and that I might need to get another surgery in future and it’s been eating up my mind because if that happens my post graduation study plans are going to be affected and also I don’t want to get into a cycle of surgeries. I am so scared and having suicidal thoughts.-Hi all. This has been something I’ve been struggling with for a while now and has been the catalyst for most of my anxiety. See a little while ago, I was scammed and blackmailed by someone who obtained a nude video of me. I managed the situation at the time and haven’t heard from the blackmailer since (I deleted all accounts that were linked to them) but they still have my full name and I worry that some day in the future, the video would be sent to my employer and it would lead to me being fired. I work as a software engineer so I can’t imagine it would actually lead me to be fired, it’s not like I’m a teacher, but it’s still a worry I have. I’m curious if any of you have any knowledge on the matter or have experienced something similar and have any advice. Thanks muchAlso, if any of you could recommend a better suited subreddit, I’d appreciate it.-I’ve been battling anxiety for many years but it has gotten more intense recently due to some events. A few days ago, I was having a panic attack and reached out to my SO via call. We’ve been together for some time but I’ve always been “closed off” in some ways. The day before, he was very supportive of my concerns which made me feel I could trust him and lean on him more.During the call, he was trying to be supportive but was unintentionally doing the opposite by continuously talking about the trigger. I tried to keep calm but eventually lost my cool and snapped at him saying “Omg. Can you please stop?”. He was hurt and said he was going to end the call. He texted me saying he just wants progress and that I don’t make it easy. He said he was sad by how I acted and hasn’t been talking to me since. I've texted him saying I know he was just trying to help and my reaction was inappropriate and explained what I felt. We still haven't been talking much.Earlier on, I had to call a helpline on behalf of my mother as she’s not very good with English. I've been putting it off as calling helplines makes me very anxious but I had to do it as she needed it done urgently. I called and everything was going okay until I needed to call Company B and then Company C to settle it. I started to feel unsettled as it was becoming more complicated than I thought. Then during the call, my mother's ringtone went off full blast next to me which I scrambled to turn it off. My thoughts started to race and when the call ended my mother was talking to me of which I snapped at her. I felt like an a-hole and broke down in my room.I feel alone in this. I feel like my SO doesn't understand my struggles simply because he doesn't go through them. I feel like I’m a broken thing that is unworthy of love. I know that’s not true and everyone deserves good things in their life but I can’t help but feel like I’m a defective object.-I get these little head taps when trying to sleep and sometimes when i try go back to sleep after waking up in the middle of the night. My anxiety has been waking me up recently. It’s weird because it feels like i am seeing flashes occasionally but not at the same time it could be just my anxiety playing tricks on me and when i try go back to sleep I’ll get random thoughts that don’t make sense like i get this one thought of me turning off a switch and when i did that it woke me up with a jolt. It’s hard to say if i am seeing flashes or not or it’s just my anxiety. Sometimes i wake up in middle of the night and just turn over and my heart just starts beating out of my chest for no reason.-Hey everyone, I hope everyone is doing alright. I wanted to gain a bit of a perspective on how I’ve been feeling. COVID has taken a bit of a mental tole, as it has for a lot of people. To sum it up, I was doing great during quarantine. Working from home, staying active, etc. I got to a point where my anxiety went through the roof. I ended up on Lexapro after consulting with a doctor and it left me worse off. I spiraled a bit and I feel as though I still have some PTSD from how it made me feel. I went off cold turkey and really found a good stride moving forward for a while.Off and on, I’ve felt great and I’ve felt anxious. I’ve consulted with a therapist and even graduated from her program. Negative thinking has been my downfall and I really give myself a hard time, especially when I’m on a longer streak of doing well. I’ve found over the last month or so that I haven’t really been enjoying things as much as I used to. I tend to search and associate other’s mental health with my own and I think I might be generating a habit of being obsessive with how I can get better. I don’t think I’m depressed, I think that these negative thoughts loops are controlling my mood. Does anyone have a similar story or success story? I recently bought “Feeling Great” by David Burns. I’ve heard good things and I think the written CBT can help me.Thanks in advance for any advice. I’m determined to get better, one day at a time.-I'm new to this anxiety world and honestly it's been a roller coaster ride so far. I have a boyfriend who loves me and I've been with him for 3 years now and it's just been great. And I come from a toxic home, my dad passed away 6 years ago and I live with my mother and sister. So my anxiety actually started when my boyfriend came back from his home town and I stayed with him for 10 days and when it was time to come back home... 3 anxiety attacks in a day. Since then I have managed it quite well and have been talking to a therapist as well. What's bugging me now is that whenever I stay at my boyfriend's place it's chill but when I come back home I have nothing really to distract me so much and the toxic environment just drives me to work more but lately I've been feeling like not working even at home and I feel if I live with my boyfriend I'll chill there too. Am I just avoiding reality? Please help.-So I used to experience this rarely, but it happens pretty often now. When ever I talk to someone and am speaking constantly, for example telling a story, I begin to feel like my body is shivering. I’m not sure why it happens, and it’s difficult to speak without others noticing that my voice is shaking. Sometimes I don’t even feel nervous, yet it’ll still make me tremble/shake. I’m assuming it’s related to my anxiety, so I was wondering if anyone has dealt with this too.-How do you guys cope with your anxiety when starting a new job? It's paralyzing and so draining.-I was just prescribed Trazodone 50mg at bedtime for sleep. While it didn't make me tired, it did seem to calm me down. Does anyone take it as needed for anxiety? Does it work in the acute setting? Any info would be helpful. Tyia!-If you come across this post please, I beg you, read until the end.Hello, yesterday I broke up with my boyfriend who I also consider my bestfriend. My life is not going very well at the moment and I feel like this was kinda the last straw. He told me he has some problems with his mental health and feels like he needs some time to himself. He says that if he can not care for me (because of the state he is in) then there's no point in staying together. To give some context we started as fuck buddies right after he broke up with his ex and then got into a serious relationship but have never said \"I love you\" to each other. He told me that he is feeling insecure about our relationship because of this as well. I feel like I am not enough for him even though I am putting my heart into this relationship. I feel so insecure because he loved his ex so much... I often ask myself what do I not have that she does? I admit that I am not a very easy person to deal with since I come from a past of emotional trauma and abuse and feel unconforable doing various things like complimenting him and saying he looks cute and so on. This and some other behaviors bother him but are not the cause of the way he is feeling. I am feeling very overwhelmed by this whole situation given the fact that I do not have a job and my family is really struggling financially. I've been finding myself having thoughts about self harm and have had various anxiety attacks where I feel like I have a huge weight on my chest and can't breathe or breathe rapidly. I have not eaten anything in 2 days and I feel like if I were to eat I would throw up.To top it all off he also said that he was scared to break up with me because of my current suicidal thoughts. When he said this I felt horrible, I felt that even without meaning it I've been manipulating him. I feel horrible, I don't know what to do but I know for a fact that I can't go on like this. He is the only joy in my life and I think that if I were to actually lose him I wouldn't be able to cope.He told me to give him some time but I don't know if I can hold on that long. I feel like I've lost a piece of my heart. I wrote this on a whim since I don't have any friends apart from my boyfriend. Leaving aside this situation I also can't find a job because there aren't any where I'm leaving and can't afford university. I don't know what to do with my life I feel like I don't have any perspectives. All I am thinking about in the last two days are dark thoughts about how maybe harming myself will alleviate this pain which I know it won't but it seems like I can't think rationally right now.-I went to a restaurant with some family a few weeks ago and ended up having such a huge panic attack that I hid in the toilets for the majority of the meal. I don't like to cause a scene and any kind of acknowledgement of a panic attack for me makes it much worse. So I just told the family that the food upset my stomach. I've had GAD for like 12 years now so I know I avoid certain places and situations if I have had a panic attack there before. So after being on my meds for about 5 weeks I thought it was time to try some exposure therapy. We booked the same restaurant and went to eat there....I had a lovely meal, didn't have any panic throughout and really enjoyed the experience. Its a relief, and although it was terrifying to even go to the restaurant again, it's proof that I can do it. It's also a reminder that I will never come off my meds again, and that's it's okay if I need them to function, it's just like an iron deficiency.I know it sounds so small, just to go to a restaurant, but if anyone would understand how great of an achievement that is, it would be you guys!-Can’t calm down my heart because I have school tomorrow-I recently went to a party for a friends birthday, got drunk and spoke to people I knew from my past. I stupidly said a lot of macho rubbish about run ins with people who are now quite sinister criminals. I didn’t sleep last night due to stomach cramps all night, going over what could happen a million times over. Petrified that something will come and take the good out of my life somehow. My youth was filled with this fear and anxiety because I was in with the wrong crowds the whole way. My life is a lot more normal now and I have good things happening.I am just scared.-nan-I have anxiety pretty badly , I’ve noticed that every time I’m on the verge of a panic attack if I try to get up or walk across the room it gets severely worse, I usually have to lay down and do absolutely nothing-I really like coffee and energy drinks but I don't know if I can't drink it with strong anxiety ?-Anxiety in Swallowing:Morning fellow redditors. I thought a lot about writing or not a post in here, but here I am. It’s been 16 days now from when it all started. I was out for the weekend with my Gf and we were enjoying our time, until when I started feeling something weird in my throat, almost like it was swollen. We were having a glass of wine and I was smoking a cigarette. Since I suffer from acid reflux I reckoned it was better off to quit with the cigs for the day, then we headed to dinner. There, I started realizing how swallowing food felt weird and I couldn’t do it no more. I stopped eating and became a little paranoid over it. Roughly 40 minutes after it, as we were walking in the city. I had an anxiety attack, and I couldn’t hold myself. My girl was there for me and tried to keep me calm, nonetheless I didn’t feel like walking or catching a metro to come home, since my Heart felt like coming out my chest. We got a taxi and headed back to the hotel, where I was able to calm down (struggling a bit) and fall asleep. The day after we sort of enjoyed our day but I didn’t feel like eating anything solid. I went asap to see a throat doctor , which told me my tonsils were a bit swollen because I got some little pieces of food stuck in it (due to the structure of the same). I started treating both my throat and my acid reflux now, but still I’m having troubles to eat, especially when I’m outside in crowded cities, where anxiety attacks me out of nowhere. My biggest fear now is to talk or stress too much about it, and influence my beloved ones, which does nothing but giving me lots of more anxiety. I’m seeing a Therapist on Wednesday and I’m taking just some plant-based medications at the moment, open to suggestions though..-Help please, my brain just keeps thinking and thinking about kind of awkward situations. Im watching Movies and shows to distract myself but right when I think of it again, my mind feels like I need to punch myself in the face. The situations I’m in are not even that bad too, like saying hi to my family members. I hate my mind and I suck at talking. Makes me angry sometimes to that I’m the way I am, lazy awkward,unmotivated fuck. Sorry for leading to venting, my mind is racing and this is some of it.-I start work tomorrow first day at a new place tomorrow, I’ve had many jobs before just been out of work for awhile and I’m feeling super nervous and anxious not in a good way.-To make a long story short; I’ve been debating for months on what I want to study. It’s come so far that the semester just began and I’m not enrolled yet. My mind and heart have figuratively been debating between five different options. They all seem interesting and each have their pros and cons although fear of failure and under qualification holds me back for two of them. I’ve noticed my mind tries to look more at possible outcomes for each of them rather than if I’d enjoy the subject. That makes it so hard to weigh out your likes versus practicality. Anyway, sorry for the long text. If any you could give some advice, I’d appreciate it much!-My family is vehemently anti-vax, and keeps talking on and on about a lot of different things. They work healthcare and it makes me sick to my stomach honestly to even think about it. I'm probably going to have to take a Klonopin just typing this out honestly I'm incredibly scared to get the Vaccine.This is ironic because I had my first dose in early August. Local store keeps calling me to go saying I'll have to restart my shots but a medical article I read said waiting between shots up to three months is more effective but they're saying if I didn't get the second shot end of August that it's ineffective entirely. I thought Canada had massive waits between shots too?Couple with upping my dose of Lexapro and an eye issue that sort of but didn't resolve that I had happen right after my first shot (going blind in one eye, mostly resolved itself after a few weeks but can't see an eye doctor until October 30th)I'm not sure what was side effects of the shot, what was from upping my dose, what was from my agoraphobia, what is just GAD, etc,. I'm genuinely freaking out but I'm terrified of getting COVID. I'm 6'5\", 260lbs, up almost forty pounds since starting treatment and I know if I get COVID I'll probably die. I have constant paranoia about being able to breath and I feel like I can't breathe even with my Oxygen being 99% (?). I know it's part of anxiety and panic attacks but the lump in my throat and dry mouth from the Lexapro don't help. I'm just not sure what to do. For the first time in months I was able to spend a few hours outside today before it got bad and I'm terrified of going to the store for my shot but I need to start working again and don't know how to find online jobs with just a HSD. I've been to the doc several times about the breathing they say I'm fine and I can't afford any more bills I can't even pay the medical bills I have they're going to collections and I'm at the point of selling all my studio gear to just pay them off but I've spent years building my collection/mic lockecamera gear. It's awful and I don't know what to do I'm sorry my thoughts are unorganized but I litert don't have anyone to talk to all my friends disappeared over the last few months due to various reasons so all the people I talk to to recharge and mentally feel better are gone and I feel like I'm going crazy in my house like I hate being stuck inside and have to change which room I sleep in every few days and can't even sleep in my bed at all so I'm just wondering what I should do about the vaccine to be able to go get a job and if I need to restart my schedule what all I have to do I don't even know if it's safe everyone says it's not and I'm terrified-nan-I was diagnosed with high functioning anxiety 7 years ago by some psychologist person thing I’m 14M and a few years later he lost his job for sending nudes to a patients mum and I haven’t really felt like I had anxiety until my brother has convinced me to talk to girls so I’m talking to someone who I like btw and she goes to my school and she also works with me but recently she told me while she was working apparently she saw the person who sexually assaulted her and when she told me my heart sunk and ever since then my stomach has felt hollow and I haven’t eaten that much and I just can’t think straight and I think it might be cause I’ve only talked to her for 4 days but I haven’t slept in over 30 hours and I don’t think it’s because the sexually assaulted thing it might because I haven’t really talked to girls like ever really and the only reason I mentioned the psychologist is because he might of false diagnosed me with high functioning anxiety and also he diagnosed me with high functioning but I just wanna know what you guys think about the situation. Also kids feel free to delete this post if it’s not related to anxiety-like i hear my name or something this just horrible feeling of dread and i gotta catch my breathe for a minute, idk could just be a me thing-so ive been living with anxiety for almost 5 years and im so tired of it. i took the university exam and i registered to a university that is far away from my city. i have to stay at a dormitory which is awful. my school is so damn big and crowded which makes me so anxious. i have lots of other problems like agoraphobia, emetophobia, depression and panic attack. my emetophobia is so damn bad it keeps me away from everything. so i can just suspend my university for one year and go back to my home and get a therapy session for one year. i want to do this because i cant stand this curse anymore. last night, i had a horrible panic attack at my dormitory room and i even thought about killing myself. my body is also affected by this situation because i cant eat or sleep. what should i do? i have 5 hours to make a decision.-This week I had to decide whether to sign for a new house I was looking to buy with my partner. I wasn’t too confident and my anxiety makes me uncomfortable with uncertainty so I would question everything about the place and the location and the price etc. It got to crunch time where I had to make a decision, my brain was telling me yes this ticks the boxes let’s just do it, but whenever I’d try and sit with that decision for even 5mins I’d have a total internal breakdown feeling nervous and scared and anxious. It got so bad I eventually had to say no not because I wanted to but because I was scared for my health and couldn’t live like that anymore.  I feel sad we didn’t get the house now. This isn’t the first time I’ve been crushed by a big decision, it’s happened before when I was trying to pick whether to take a new job or not. I talk with my therapist about this, and they usually try to get me to listen to my gut and intuition but this absolutely doesn’t work for me. I’m so riddled with terrible anxiety that my gut just wants to pick the easy option out - in this case not buying the home. I think I might need to get on medication to help me through, but my anxiety is normally very manageable. Does anybody else experience this?-Currently having a panic attack that’s lasted for about an hour already and there’s no end in sight. When most of your anxiety comes from the fear of dying, and panic attacks make you feel like you’re dying, it’s tough to get out of it. Keep me distracted please lol.-I can't cope with any stressor and I've got 3 in two days, I'm just gonna have to battle.my way through it as best as I can what else can I do well aside from the obvious harm or just give up completely. I dunno gotta try ain't I even when I don't feel quite right quite here quite present. Still gotta keep going.-I would like to consider myself mildly okay at containing my anxiety at this point in my life, but interviews are the bane of my existence. I have an interview in 2 1/2 days and while I'm grateful it's not in person, I despise talking on the phone.Regardless, how have you guys gotten through interviews? For some reason it's one of those extremely hated things where I feel like I'm gonna throw up or stop breathing, like it's very bad. My usual tricks don't really work because I'm surrounded in an environment where I want to run but can't. I guess I just never knew how to confidently talk about myself while being very very judged while doing it.-I am a current university student (I am also diagnosed with ADHD) so school is something that always stresses me out. I have a very challenging upcoming semester ahead of me and I’m ungodly nervous about it. I have talked with my therapist many times about how I have no reason to be afraid because I always do well in my classes in the past. But this feeling makes me wanna throw up. I always assume the worst in a lot of areas of my life (especially school) do to the fear of living the same life my parents did raising my siblings and I. We grew up in poverty and all my parents want me to do is not end up where they are. Any tips please? thank you.-Hey all, my doctor prescribed me 50 mg of Zoloft a few days ago. I wanted to start medication again because in even somewhat uncomfortable situations my heart beat speeds up, I get nauseous, and I visibly shake. I’m currently on day three of the medication, and my anxiety has increased a lot, even in situations that I normally wouldn’t be anxious in. I’ve never had a full blown panic attack but I felt like I was going to have one just trying to watch a movie in public today. The day before I almost skipped lunch because the idea of talking to a drive thru cashier made me start shaking.I’ve been on Zoloft before years ago. I think my doctor started me on 25 mg before moving me up to 100 and I didn’t feel any side effects ever.I want to try and feel better as soon as possible, and I know the side effects can last a week or so. Should I lower to 25mg? That being said, I don’t want my original symptoms to come back either. Or would I benefit more from staying at 50.I start a new job in a week and the idea of being a nauseous shaky mess makes me even more anxious.-i’ve never been particularly anxious but ever since i started my second year of uni and still being confused about my future has been so stressful. i can barely sleep into 6am, i’m constantly overthinking, my heart rate is extremely fast and my nicotine dependency is coming back. i’ve also been crying over the dumbest things for the last 3 nights and it goes on for hours. i got fired from my job yesterday and that was the icing on the cake for me, i’ve been in a constant state of panic and fear even though i was able to snag another job within a day. now im terrified about this new one— i’ve already lost a minimum wage job so i feel like a major loser, what happens if i lose this one too? what if i can’t keep up with the hours and balance school? what if i do poorly in school? does anyone have any advice on how to deal with these new emotions? im so scared-Said something kinda invalidating of someone else’s experience, I think just trying to relate and find connection, but immediately regretted it . Not a close person in my life , but strong urge to apologize and correct myself . Wondering if it would be for me tho, and not for them..-I ordered chicken soup from my favorite pho place tonight. I noticed after a few bites that it tasted kind of off, but I ignored it at first thinking it was too much cilantro. Pretty soon I realized it was the chicken that tasted and smelled weird. I hadn't put all of it into the soup yet, and I tried to take out the pieces that were left in there and just eat the noodles and veggies. Now I'm wondering why I didn't just toss the whole thing. I ate some of that chicken and drank the broth it was in. I'm so scared I'm going to get food poisoning that I actually tried to make myself sick earlier. I've always had issues with health anxiety. Has anyone been through this? Did it end up being okay? I'm so afraid.-I just won a little battle with anxiety today! My anxiety is generalised but mostly stems from severe emetophobia, to the point where I often struggle to leave the house in case I suddenly get sick while away from my safe space. Today I took the dog for a walk, on my own. I took her down to the beach, let her off the lead (I never do this unless my husband is with me because I'm terrified she will run off) and walked her for over an hour. We did the whole beach, through the cliffside gardens and I only put her back on the lead when we got onto the streets. Also, I didn't take my anti-emetics with me. Feeling very proud of myself. F*** you anxiety!-Hey all I’m a guy in my mid 20’s. How do you get over general/social anxiety and being shirtless around people?I have one housemate (a girl around my age, we met a couple months ago). When I’m home alone I like to just chill shirtless, I sleep shirtless, fine swimming or being at the beach shirtless. But it’s getting warmer and I’d like to be more comfortable just being shirtless at home, or after a run or workout or whatever. Is that weird? How can I get more comfortable with that?-I'm working as a cook at a restaurant right now (the owner is a family friend which is the only reason I'm comfortable there), but I'm trying to find a REMOTE job so I can have more flexibility with where I'm located. But every time I look at job listings I start bawling, because1. Dont feel like I can do it2. \"Must be able to work well under pressure and in a fast-paced environment\"3. Nothing looks interestingSo...is there anyone here that has been successful finding a good remote job that works well with anxiety? And how did you find it?I have a bachelors degree in communication, but only very amateur experience in anything :/-nan-nan-I just wanted to know if anybody else has an irrational fear of being drugged or poisoned. its so weird idk why its gotten this bad. say you go to a gas station and the bags of chips are lined up ill get the one in the middle thinking if somebody tampered with it it wouldnt be that one and that goes for anything. i recently had an anxiety attack because i touched the keypad to put in the pin for my debit card and i convinced myself it had lsd on it. it sounds ridiculous. i wont drink water bottles if i have left them out of my sight for too long. ill buy fast food and look at it and if i see something i dont liked i.e black speck i wont eat any of it i turn the water bottle cap when i buy them to make sure the seal hasnt been broken. i wont touch doorknobs or other house hold objects for the fear of drug residue on it ( my mother has recently gotten back on meth thats why but ive been like this beforehand ) i wont eat food in the fridge at my own home because i think its either drugged or poisoned. it didnt use to be this bad it just recently got this way. i dont know if this anxiety related but i get anxious about it. could anybody shed some light? what kind of help should i seek out to get rid of this. please anything.-I get panic attacks when I'm not talking to multiple women at once. Like I can't sleep at night when there aren't at least two girls on my phone at once.At one point in junior year I was with multiple girls at once. My friends used to joke I had a girl for each day of the week. Now, I am not “attractive”. There have been girls that found me to be attractive, but I’m not a ten, nine, or eight. Personally I’d say on a good day I’m a six. However, I just hit on women relentlessly. Like, if I don’t hit a certain quota by the end of the day, I feel bad. When I get rejected, I never really think about for more than ten seconds. Like it doesn't affect me and I just move on.Ok, let me use an example, you know when you go to the gym, and then you leave the gym and you’re like “I could have stayed and done more” yeah, that feeling.I can’t help it, if I don’t have at least three girls texting me at once, I feel anxious.I want to ask my therapist if I’m a narcissist but I don’t want to at the same time.The worst thing about all of this is, I enjoy making women cry for me. Like it feels so gratifying. Like you know that feel good after you do a good deed. Like that, I’ve fantasized about making women cry for me from a young age. Sometimes I’ll start random stuff just to make them cry.-I went to party today around 5 and drank some wine and a shot of tequila but it never got me feeling tipsy or anything and stopped drinking at around maybe 7:30-8pm and around 12 am I felt my self getting anxious so I took half of a 0.5mg of clonazepam which was prescribed to me for moments when I feel an anxiety attack coming. I’m just kind of paranoid as I saw online that it was extremely dangerous to mix alcohol with this medication, but I completely forgot I had drank alcohol today as I just felt my anxiety come and I went straight to take the clonazepam, is everything fine or should I be worried about mixing the 2 in this situation?-hi! first time using reddit here.I just wanted to share a bit of what goes on in my mind and see if anyone else relates because I try to google what might be going on with me but nothing feels 100% right.My mind is always overthinking. I didn't even realize it until people starting calling me funny whenever I described my thought process. That also made me realize how much of a pessimist I am.In most areas of my life, I'm perfectly fine. But when it comes to relationships and work, I get extremely stressed out to the point of spiraling. It could be mild, but other times it gets so intense that I'm unable to stay present and get really distant or the only way to make it stop is sleep. As I've recognized this pattern, it's gotten worse. A few days ago, I literally had to force myself to sleep to prevent myself from killing myself.But this is the weird part, all of these spirals only last a couple days tops. And when they're over, either feel like I'm on cloud nine or stable but that's also only for a couple days tops. Sometimes the being distant thing goes on for a few weeks but that's it. Most of the time I feel like I'm living in a state where I'm neither happy nor sad nor empty, just cautiously living. I'm just so confused because all the anxiety and depression disorders seem to be constant but it's not for me, but when I am experiencing feels WAY too intense to be \"sadness\".I should also mention that I can never be productive for more than a couple days. I'm either procrastinating and practically making myself think about anything other than what I should be doing. OR crunching because I'm mega stressed about the fact I should be doing something productive. Sometimes I'll even be stressed and still procrastinate.I know that was a lot but I gotta know if anyone else relates or has any advice. Any thoughts are greatly appreciated.-Help—Idk how to explain to my boyfriend what it’s like to have social anxiety and depression.  He’s a social butterfly and can’t understand why I am the way I am.  He gets so frustrated with me.  Tonight, we went to a wedding where he was one of the groomsman and I was not in the wedding party.  I knew little to no people at this party so I was very uncomfortable but did my best to look cheery and happy.  I worked so hard to look comfortable and happy despite being deeply uncomfortable.  I showed up to the wedding at 4 and made it through the ceremony maintaining my composure. But at around 8pm this whole situation started to become too much for me.  We were seated at the wedding party table and both went to the bathroom and when he came out he didn’t wait for me. Instead he went to go and mingle with friends.  I got out of the bathroom and looked for him but he was no where to be found.  The wedding planner told me to take a seat so the first dance could begin.  I was back at the table directly behind the couple doing their first dancing with the rest of the wedding party sans boyfriend.  At this point I’m freaking out, everyone at the table is canoodling with their significant other during this romantic song and I’m just there.  Alone.  Trying to make it look like I belong and am super happy because I’m gonna be in the background of all of their photos.  I don’t know these people, I met them 2 days ago.   I finally spot my boyfriend and he has just standing across the floor laughing with his friends as I wave to him to come back to sit and he just stands there laughing with him friends.After the first dance, I took my purse to go sit inside and compose myself.  I’m on the verge of crying at how awkward I feel.  My boyfriend follows me in and is mad at me about going inside.  I ask him to please leave me alone so I can put myself together but he is getting progressively more and more frustrated with me.     He says my feelings don’t make sense and I continuously say that he can’t understand how I’m feeling but please have some empathy and  don’t get mad at me.  I ask him to please leave me and go rejoin the wedding because he will be missed.  I even try to say maybe we can talk about this in the morning because we have been drinking. I really don’t want to ruin this wedding.  I’m just feeling overwhelmed plus I don’t want everyone to know that I have debilitating anxiety.. He will not leave me alone, he is the kind of person who wants to fix things right there.  He says I’m not explaining how I’m feeling and why and at this point I’m straight up balling because he is getting very frustrated at me.  I have no idea what to do.  I don’t know how to explain to someone that doesn’t understand what it’s like to have anxiety and he can’t tell when I’m about to go into full on panic mode.  I try to tell in the moment when I’m feeling uncomfortable but he just thinks i can “power through” and then when I can’t he makes me feel bad about leaving the situation and says that i’m ruining the party.  How can I make him understand?-Every movement is monitored and judged. I wish I could explain my actions. Explain why I do the things I do.  Please don't judge me. I can't stand the idea of someone looking down on me.  It paralyzes me.-Hi guys I am currently super nervous because I am driving an hour away on the freeway to go to the neurologist for my agoraphobia and panic disorder. At least my dad is driving so it will be a little better but I feel it’s going to be really roughI was wondering if anyone has any tips for calming down my thoughts while on the freeway.I fear not having off ramps available in long stretches of road and traffic.My biggest fear is that I will become stuck in traffic and start to panic without a way to get home. I am also afraid that when I’m about 40ish minutes out I will panic because I know it’s a long way to get home. I think a big part of me still believes that panic can last forever and can hurt me and I still struggle with the thoughts immensely. Any tips or words of advice would be appreciated cause I am really nervous right now.Thanks!- I'm a 20/F and the other day I went to a party and this boy I liked was flirting with me, I knew that if I went with him alone he would try to kiss me and I panicked, my heart was beating super fast and I was extremely nervous, so basically I nicely refused to go on a walk with him. I regret that SO much, but at that moment I just shut down. Since then I have been uneasy and anxious I'm not sure why, I just feel bad that I couldn't pull myself together, I have never kissed anybody because any time there might be an opportunity I just sabotage it. I also lowkey feel ashamed of being this old and still haven't had my first kiss.What should I do to improve my anxiousness:((-Many of my therapists, psychiatrists, and favorite mental health resources have recommended visualization techniques to reduce my late-night anxiety that keeps me from going to sleep. However, whenever I start doing these exercises, my mind quickly goes to dark and scary thoughts, which can even cause panic attacks. What type of exercises can I try that don't require much mindfulness?-Hello,I have written this a couple days ago but I'm still worried. So, I got the CAT scan (CT scan) with contrast  on Thursday noon. I developed hives over it on Thursday night, which the doc thinks it's a delayed adverse reaction. I took Zyrtec and it went away.The only thing I'm worried right now is the allergy coming back (cause I've heard it can still happen after a week). My throat is still dry, and I feel like something is inside my throat (like a sore throat). This sore throat started happening on Saturday, and it has been continuing for the last 24-30 hours. I'm not sure if it's getting worse because it has been staying the same.I'm worried if this is an early symptom of an anaphylactic shock that could cause me not to breathe suddenly. Anyone that can help me out here?-What caused it, how often, triggers? Solutions? Basically over the last few months my body has been on off having sleep paralysis cycles. It’s exhausting and I want to get information before I take it further. Neurologist and sleep therapy + EEG in the near future.-For the past 4 months my life been full of anxiety and depression and stress since my dog passed away. Last Sunday I thought I had a heart attack while I was at my mothers house, but apparently it turned out and anxiety attack. I have never experienced anything like this before my heart was racing I felt my arms and my legs tingling and numb I was shacking uncontrollably. After going to ER they got my blood work and X-ray and EKG they didn’t find anything wrong. I went back home and I felt the same way again. After 3 days my stomach started to hurt me a lot like everything I eat and doesn’t digest well and I have a gassy stomach and my throat or esophagus burns. I also have a darker spots on my stool but I take Iron supplements so I associate it with that and I also get externe cramps and my life side below my rips it hurts so bad when I touch it. I get scared when I go places now thinking the anxiety attack will happen again. What should I do I’m always scared that I have something or a health issues every time I feel something I freak out and I start googling stuff to see if what I’m feeling is normal. I just need an advice idk what to do. I’m always in fear about my health I feel like I have some many diseases and cancers in my body and I can’t stop thinking about it. I also had excessive thirst and I am peeing every 5 mins for some weird reason.-I have the nagging sense that I might have to ask an old employer for something. I have so much anxiety about asking for references, or following up with past employers, especially ones which I did not end things with perfectly. Advice ?-does anyone have any tips with how to deal with this? i’m really stressed right now and anxious about everything so i’m having a hard time trying to eat. i can barely even swallow oatmeal :( anything is appreciated 😊-Hi!I’ve been on 1mg of clonazepam 1x a day, and a .5mg on an as needed basis for 15 years now. This medicine helped my agoraphobia and anxiety immensely up until a year or so ago. I guess it’s either not working anymore due to how long I’ve been on it or I need a higher dose…I don’t want a higher dose and I honestly want to get off of this medicine. Kinda mad at myself for staying on a benzo for so long. I’m no longer agoraphobic but my anxiety is definitely still here. I’m sure it wouldn’t be as bad if my life wasn’t basically in shambles but ehh.. Any advice on tapering and/or other anti anxiety medicines that aren’t benzodiazepines?Thanks 😊-It was almost painful. Now I have pain in my back/shoulders and I can’t tell if I’m having a minor panic attack because of what just happened, or if something is really wrong. Anyone else ever have a really hard skipped beat like that? I’m freaking out at the moment-I have been sitting at home doing nothing for the past 6 years after i dropped out of highschool due to issues (16 back then, im 22 now) i didnt care back then because i was a kid and loved having no responsibilities and doing nothing but ive gotten to a point where all i can constantly think of is that im 22 and havent gotten anywhere in life yet and im getting scared for the future,  after years of being lazy i also built up an insane amount of anxiety , family offerd to pay for my scooter license since we live pretty deserted and scooters are a great way to get around where i live but i struggle to make myself even study and take the tests, let alone getting a job if i do manage to get the license, i remember getting an anxiety attack about 3 years ago while i was only thinking about getting a job and looking around, i spent the entire night crying not knowing what to do and it destroyed me mentallyIt sickens myself that i havent gotten anywhere yet and that i am what i am right now, a part of me would love to get a job, get an income and socialize since i have been rather lonely for the past years and loneliness is what got me into a depression too, but im also scared and havent been able to make myself do anything even though i dont wanna continue living my life the way i have for the last few yearsAny help is appreciated, would love to hear what helped you or someone you know if you had a similar issue-And right now I'm typing this to keep Myself distracted as it's a 45 min trip on the interstate with several bridges Idk if this is the right place to do this but I figured you'd understand. We went to Hollowscream tonight which was awesome! The scare actors truly are masters of their craft. I think it would be really cool to be one actually! Idk what kind of training you need or prior experience,  I would guess maybe some improv studies or acting background but maybe not! I think if I got the chance I'd be one in costume, something lanky and speedy lol The park itself was extremely immersive with the lighting and practical effects and absolutely has an otherworldly vibe. It'd best to experience everything at night time I think though, for obvious reasons. They didn't have many scare houses though I think 5 in total but they were all very well planned put and executed.I couldn't help but admire the costumes and props when I was supposed to be getting the bejesus scared put of me! I've never been to Hollowscream before so I didn't know what to expect but I definitely wasn't disappointed and I wanna go back as soon as possible! People drive so damn fast on the interstate Holy shit So reckless This being my first ever spooky experience as an adult really makes me want to experience a tad more extreme haunts, something that can absolutely deny me the leisure or comfort of admiring the art behind it I've never really looked into it though, you got any recommendations?There was this one place I heard of called McKammie manoror something like that where they were borderline torturing the participants, I dunno how into that I am lol just thought ot was note worthy Ughhhhjjjj she's going 40 in a 65 Fuckfyckfuckfuck She doesn't take kindly to me saying anything about her driving and honestly it drives me insane it's just so fucking dangerous and I don't understand how she's totally ok with it, like Idk dude, of you aren't comfortable enough to make these trips them we shouldn't like it's fine ugh If I say anything though she will snap and drive even more careless Anyway shit Did you know that an elephant eats up to 100 fruits away while humans require 9?I learned that at Busch Gardens Their massive dudes that's for sure We saw them tonight for a little bit I wo Der what the animals were thinking about Hollowscream hahaa Must've been pretty confusing There weren't many animals in their enclosures tonight for obvious reasons but the elephants were because where else could you keep tbem?!As I was petting a Kangaroo last time we were there during the day I kind of got sad for the little animal dudes who live their whole lives at busch gardens Do you think they miss being free? Or were they maybe rescued? Idk Seeing the way they all just kind of Lounged made me wonder. How would you feel if you got everything you needed and wanted but couldn't leave a cage? Kind of a conflicting thought tbh lol Were finally getting off the interstate so imma wrap it Sorry to the Mods if this breaks rules and also any typos as it was just rapid fire but I hope it was at least read worthy as ot was definitely helpful Cheers-just wanted to share this because it helped me so much this evening. i was sitting at the couch doing nothing and noticed that my anxiety increased without any reason and yeah ... im still bad at stopping a panic attack (especially since i stopped drinking, because that was my coping mechanism). so i went to my room and threw up a stress ball and catched it really fast for like 10 minutes because that helps a bit but it didnt stopped the panic attack. so i put in headphones and turned on really loud and catchy music like the one that is played in clubs and danced. i danced for ... idk lol 30 minutes? i mean i REALLY danced i jumped and such things lol and i guess it looked really weird but who cares. i fucking felt the music and couldnt think about anything. it was awesome because guess what? my anxiety was gone and when i stopped i felt soooo good. you may know that you release a lot happiness hormones while dancing so it really helps. like i said just wanted to share, maybe it helps some if you :))-It’s my fifth year in university. I changed my major and went to another uni and tomorrow my third year there starts but for some reason, I am anxious as hell. I’m an introverted guy and I get nervous and anxious about social situations pretty often but I’m used to that and can deal with it pretty easily but this time I don’t even know what I am anxious about. The feeling is just there for about a week and I’ve been acting pretty aggressive or moody towards everyone. In the past I dealt with it by just fighting it until it disappeared but this time I just feel so burnt out to fight it which is kinda scary for me. Any advice is appreciated :/-So fatigued all day everyday, can barely do the most basic tasks. I am bedbound most of the time due to this unrelenting fatigue and anxiety symptoms. Is anybody here in a similar situation?-Does anyone else get scared to sleep. Not because I’m scared of dying in my sleep or terrible things happening but the thought that I will have to wake up and do everything again the next day. It makes me sometimes unable to sleep unless I’m really tired and then the next day I feel even more shitty. It’s like I’m trying to stop time because when you sleep it feels like time just speeds up ? Idk I just hate the thought of waking up the next day mainly on school days or sometimes weekends because I don’t want to waste the only time I have so I stay up late and can’t sleep-Ever since Covid began, I developed this huge anxiety around being able to breathe. I'll be so worried I won't be able to breathe, while I'm sitting there breathing, or worried that I can't inhale enough of a breath, or that I'm suddenly going to be unable to breathe. It usually doesn't afflict me during the day, but it plagues me greatly at night when I'm trying to fall asleep or any other moments when I'm trying to just relax and not do anything. When I am not preoccupied with something, my mind won't rest and I'll start overthinking my breathing. I'll lay there for so long worried I'm not able to breathe well enough, even though I'm laying there breathing the same as I always have. Rationally, I know I'm breathing and I'm fine, but I can't stop myself from worrying.When the pandemic first hit, for the first couple of months it plagued me every night and during the day when I was alone. When I first woke up, it felt like I was on the verge of a panic attack because I felt so anxious about being able to breathe. It gradually grew less intense, and it hasn't really affected me so much for a while until now. Today, while trying to fall asleep, I was right on the edge of falling asleep when the anxiety suddenly hit me and I found myself overanalyzing my breathing. I must've just laid here for twenty minutes worried I'm not able to breathe well enough before I decided to post here.What can I do to alleviate this anxiety? I even went to the doctor a couple weeks ago for a regular checkup, and when he checked my breathing, he said it was good and didn't have anything remarkable to say. Despite that, I'm still feeling this way.-So I (30M) wrote in some other subreddits about my experience in trauma  bonding relationship with a psychiatry resident. I’ve been out of the  relationship for several months and am taking anti depressants and going  to therapy; which is how I leaned about trauma bonding. I’ve been  getting slowly better but I still think about her. And I try not to. I  almost feel like I’m in  a competition with her and myself to get myself  healthy again and find someone new. I’ve been told to hold off on  dating again till I heal more which I am. I guess I put all my  trust in  her and her being a doctor in training and having her do all this to me  has made me question everything and everyone and I really don’t trust  anyone anymore or myself. And I don’t want to hurt any new girl that  might come into my life. I don’t know what to do some days, I feel  broken still and other days I feel fine. I hate it, I want to be normal  again but I can never forgot what happened. I have anxiety about meeting  new women and comparing them to her. Some days I just break down and  cry because I’m mad at myself for being with her and mad at her for  making me this way. If anyone has any advice or guidance I’d appreciate  it.-I have a lot of health anxiety these days surrounding my migraines and an upcoming move. However, even on days when I feel perfectly fine and like myself again, I’ll get slapped with a random bout of nausea and sometimes I end up gagging. I fortunately have not thrown up at all but it gets intense and I’ll have to just sit there for a bit not doing anything. This obviously will then spark some anxiety. Does this happen to anyone else? Good days, bad days, it doesn’t matter. The nausea almost seems constant these days.-Hi, does anybody else have anxiety while driving alone? I get really anxious of even thinking of doing it, I did it only once and I got in the wrong road twice, whilst almosting hit a parked bus.The thing is, if I have someone else on the car with me I'm okay, there's still the normal anxiety but it's manageable, driving solo makes me crazy though.Did anyone find a way to get over this? I have no problem doing other things alone, in fact I prefer doing almost everything by myself, but driving alone is a strong no.-I’ve been struggling with pretty bad social anxiety for several years now, I did CBT for a while and I didn’t really think it would actually help? But today I went and got my covid vaccine by myself and I was still anxious but it was actually a manageable amount of anxiety not an oh-my-gosh-i’m-gonna-die amount. It all went really well and I could actually talk to the nurse calmly and yeah, it was awesome to actually feel a noticeable difference? I feel really proud of myself.-Forgive me if you saw me post yesterdayI am strongly considering talking to my doctor about starting Paxil again after weaning off last summer after being on it for 6 years. Yesterday was rough. Couldn't get out of bed, worrying about the future, stomach aches, no motivation to finish school work I desperately had to do, pounding headaches from crying. Finally got up at 3 pm, tried to do Doordash to make some money. Drove about a mile, felt my chronic illness start to flare (which I'm convinced anxiety is a major cause of it), turned around and went home. Made no money just wasted gas. Today I feel okay, maybe even good. Successfully did a few Doordash orders, now working on homework, albeit a bit hard to focus. Yesterday I felt 100% I needed Paxil. I have an old bottle of 10mg pills I was tempted to take (I used to take 40 mg everyday). Today, not so much. It makes me question myself and if I really need to go back on. How did you know it was time to talk to your doctor?-Side note I don’t smoke weed at all esp nowOne night I had smoked weed and I started to feel hot my blood pressure went up and my heart started to beat really fast so I had to go to the emergency room they had to put me on IV to get the weed or high out my systemEver since then I have been having random panic attacks out of no where where my heart start beating fast like pounding like crazy and I literally don’t be doing much like I don’t be excercising or anything it starts beating fast out of nowhere  I had put on a heart monitor and the cardiologist had got the results back and said that I have slight arrhythmia For example when I take a shower especially at night my heart starts racing and I start to hyperventilate and have panic attacks  Anyone else experience this any advice ???-I am in my late 20s and always had a lot of social anxiety. As a result I lied a lot to fit in. I lied that I went to a public school instead of a private school, I never said my brother did a phd, or that my parents are business owners. Also never told some people i had a sister. All of this because I am afraid of being judged as wealthy and also did not want any sister jokes that guys so. Also I never said a lot of other things about my self.I always feel really uncomfortable sharing any details about myself for people possibly judging me  as wealthy. Now I am scared if i start telling the truth people will be mad at me for having not shared these things with them before.Anyone have any advice?-I’ve had anxiety for a few years but these past couple of months are the worst it’s ever been. One night I was just sitting there and was hit with a wave of dread/ fear - then what followed was a racing heart, trembling arms/ legs, cold sweats, and what I can only describe as feeling like I’m falling. I managed to calm down in the following minutes but ever since then I’ve been getting these random attacks on and off, which of course is only making my general anxiety worse, which only leads to overthinking and more of these episodes. I’m on the fence about whether or not these can be classified as panic attacks, as they don’t seem as severe as other people on here are describing (I have no chest pain, hyperventilation, feeling like I’m dying, the works). Could these be considered panic attacks?-Hello,I am not sure if I should post this question here but here it goes. I have had anxiety since college but this month has been terrible. I am constantly anxious and emotional. It is interfering with my daily life. I am irritable as well and get angry very quickly. I think I have every psych condition I read about and it is making it even worse. My psychiatrist put me on buspar which is some what keeping the anxiety down but its still very much there. He tried to put me on wellbutrin since it has worked for me in the past but I stopped taking it once I found out I was pregnant. However this time around it made me even more anxious and I stopped taking it after three days. I know the next logical step is an SSRI. I am worried about the sexual side effects but honestly the anxiety has made my libido non existent at the moment. I am thinking that I will feel like this forever and that is such a horrible feeling. Any advice?-I've been having such a hard time lately. The anxiety is through the roof at a all time high. Which is only making my depression crippling. I am almost at my limit with this. And I won't lie I have had many dark thoughts lately. I have no energy for anything anymore.So if anyone has ever been to one how was it? Was it helpful?To add my mom years ago put herself in one and said it was super helpful. And that I should never feel embarrassed about going.-I don’t really know how to explain it, it’s like you don’t feel your hands but you actually do. They just feel lighter than usual, not numb. I can do things normally with my hands but they feel like feathers if that makes sense. I really dont know how to explain it better than this-I have a conversation with anyone and I instantly after the conversation has ended feel anxious that I said something wrong or didn’t come across as interested or I gave off a bad vibe. Today I bumped into my brother in law at the supermarket and after walking away instantly felt my chest tighten in case I came across as awkward 😢-So ever since I witnessed 2 family members go thru heart attacks. I have started this irrational fear of having one myself. Being 26 and having lost weight I know I'm healthy. Deep down I do know it. The Dr tells me I am and gives me medicine to help the anxiety. But I can't take the medicine because the first thing I do is google symptoms and freak myself out. I hardly eat anymore because I think it's gonna kill me. I set myself into panic attacks where I check my pulse and convince myself that it's not normal. I know at this point I'm sick but idk who to turn to. My family just laughs and says it's all in my head. And I know that. But here I am. Making my first post on Reddit after 2 years of dealing with this. Idk how to stop myself from being afraid to eat, from checking my pulse constantly, or pinching my skin to see if it's numb on my arm. Im just tired or the constant fear.-What does the ER when you show up with anxiety/panic attacks? Asking for a friend.-My anxiety has always won over anything I've tried to do. Sometimes I am able to push through and force myself to do things I don't want to but other times I avoid simple tasks or errands because I overthink every possible outcome. My girlfriend of a year and a half has been asking me to go out of state to meet her family and it's crippling me to even think about going. They have a tight knit family and I can't stop imagining how bad my anxiety will be if I go with her for a week. I tried to explain it to her and she said she feels like I use my anxiety as a crutch to get out of doing things. She later apologized when she saw how heartbreaking it was for me to hear that. I've always kept my feelings and anxious thoughts to myself for that exact reason. I never want to be seen as handicapped or like I'm using my mental state as an excuse. I just don't know what to do about any of this. Any advice or free treatment options would be greatly appreciated.-I’ve been on low dose lorazepam since 2007. My prescription is as needed. Anxiety is my thing. I was also recommended anti depressants as a way to calm my anxiety. Lexapro( big no)- I had the body tremors. Trentellix- not bad. Is just rolling with lorazepam ok?-Does anyone really struggle on a night? It’s currently 1:53am and I have to get up at 7am to take my step children to school but I can’t sleep. I’m extremely anxious. I’m struggling to settle and struggling even more to sleep. I feel so lonely.-I developed some serious health anxiety about a year  ago. I put off taking meds for so long because I was scared of side effects. 2 months ago I started because anything could be better than the way I was feeling. One month on 50mg did nothing. Started to lose hope that I would be this way forever. Started 100mg almost a month ago and I finally have hope. I can feel things changing for the better. Might need one more dosage increase to fully kick anxietys ass but wow things are getting better.-You just think what could have been if you hadn’t been cursed with this illness and the places you would have gone and relationships you could have had. I’ve missed out on literally everything in life. I’m 31 now and my entire 20s flew by and I didn’t get to enjoy them at all. I’ve been crippled by this shit my entire life. I live at home right now with my mom because I’m Fkn broke. I’ve been out of work for 3 years except 2 jobs I couldn’t hold down for longer than a month during that time span so I don’t count those obviously. I’m starting a shitty call center job that’s remote from home In 2 weeks that’s basically an entry level job for 22 year olds so why I went to college and got a bachelors I have no Fkn idea since I’ve done nothing with it and still have all my student loans to pay back. Childhood was okay I guess but I can’t even remember the happy memories from back then because my mind is so Fkn far gone I can’t think clearly my memory is non existent. All I have are regrets. I have nothing to live for there’s nothing in life I enjoy. Everything, my entire existence has been consumed by this shit for as long as I canRemember and I’m truly ready for this to all end. Even if after death is just nothingness I’m still pretty sure that’s be better then this artificial bullshit life. I dont remember the last timeI felt an emotion other than fear or despair.-Hello, I am sorry in advance in this is not a right place to ask but I don't know where else to try and I'm desperate.In February I moved in with two guys I know (but I wouldn't call them friends though). The flat is actually one of this guys mom's so she is our landlord. Stupidly I signed a contract for a whole year.It was all right at first but then I realised how unhappy I was there, the boys were not cleaning after themselves or taking care of anything, they were living \"students life\" and since I started working it's been problematic for me.For the last few months I felt so anxious around the house that I couldn't even leave my room. Now im paying for that room but I'm spending most of the time at my parents house.But I found a cute and affordable place, all for myself. I've already contacted the owner and I can move in November. But the problem is that technically I have a valid contract at that previous place until February 2022. I'd have to call the landlady and ask her to terminate the contract and let me go earlier. But I feel so anxious to call her, I am terrified that she won't be happy with my decision or even say that I cannot move out earlier. Do you please have any tips on how to find strength to make this conversation?-Does anyone else get these bizarre and brief head rushes like a vertigo feeling with their anxiety?I’ve gotten these a few times over the past few years where I’ll be doing anything like standing doing nothing or working on my computer and get these weird head rush feelings that last a few seconds then go away. Today, it happened twice back to back and then had a minor tension headache. I felt anxious afterward because it’s unsettling and now I’m here thinking I had a mini stroke or something. I’ve been pretty stressed and anxious lately since I have a lot going on in my life right now, so I’m hoping it’s just related to that.-it’s so annoying like i’ll be in a zoom class, and i’ll talk and stuff and be myself and then afterward i replay it in my head and just think “what if i was being too much” or “what if saying this was perceived in a bad way” and i don’t get it and i just wish it’d stop like i know it’s pointless but dumb but i can’t make it go away. it’s been like so bad lately and this never used to really happen until recently. i’ve always had anxiety but this is like a new thing and i’m not a fan.-I hope this doesn't go against the rules. I'll delete it if so. Also TW for anxiety, panic disorder, medication, panic attacks and talk of death. For a bit of back story, I've had anxiety since I was 5 years old and was left alone. My anxiety of the jump was panic attacks and less of day-to-day anxiety. Also, my trigger is usually thinking that I'll die. More specifically not having any control over my thoughts anymore and less of physical death. (I'm not trying to get into religion or anything but my thoughts on the afterlife are kind of just ur dead and have no control over anything mentally or physically.) Last year, I had a really bad panic attack one of the worst I've ever had and ended up going to the doctor a couple of days afterward to talk about it. I did get prescribed a  small dose (like 2 or 3 pills) of anxiety meds. (I'm not sure what exactly. ) It was kind of just a last resort thing if no one could control my panic attack. However, I only got the meds because I asked for it and therapy was pushed heavily. My dad kept the prescription and I was told I had to ask him for it. I haven't taken it at all but there were a couple of times I wanted to ask for it. I've talked to him about wanting to keep control over it and take it if I see fit instead of asking him and it would give me a lot of peace of mind. He said he didn't have an issue with it, just that I've never had the pill before and he wants someone around the first time I take it in case I have a bad reaction. That was a few months ago and we haven't really talked about it since. Well, these past few months my anxiety has less and less been about panic attacks where it's now more of day-to-day anxiety. It's been really bad lately. I really want to go on a medication that I take daily because I don't think a pill that will calm me down in a panic attack is helpful as I'm not really having panic attacks. Also, with the therapy thing, I did talk to my uncle who is a professional therapist in the states but I didn't talk to him too much because he was family and I didn't talk with him too frequently. It was more just to get my dad off my back about talking to someone. I am now open to having a therapist I just didn't want it over the phone or zoom I need face-to-face interaction and covid and now school has been in the way a bit. However, it's really annoying me that whenever I talk about wanting to go on medication everyone says therapy first because I've always known my triggers, the cause of my anxiety and how to calm myself down in a panic attack. I get the intentions are pure but for the longest time, I was dead set against getting a therapist cause I had a bad experience when I was younger. So saying I want one now is a big deal for me, but I don't want it to be I can go on medication only if I talk to someone first. Does anyone have any advice? How should I ask for medication without firstly getting therapy? Thank uuu xx-How can I tell if my Xanax is fake and not Medical grade?-I’ve recently been listening to different frequencies on YouTube whenever I can, and I’ve actually found some to be really helpful. Whether it’s a placebo effect or it really works, they definitely help lower my anxiety levels especially during panic attacks. The frequency I find the best for anxiety is 396Hz but I also find 432Hz and 528Hz effective. Does anyone else suffering from anxiety listen to these frequencies? If not maybe give it a go and tell me if it made you feel any better, I was low-key shocked at how it made me feel after about 45 mins of listening :)-Somehow this happens with almost everyone I know. It’s usually about how much time they take to respond. For example if they take more than three to four hours to respond, I get anxiety and think they don’t like me anymore. Or if they just don’t respond at all I get worried. I just overthink their responses all the time, I don’t know why. Even if they do respond I think about how they responded and whether it was dry or not. This usually happens more often with online friends, but it even happens with my irl friends. I hate that I have this. I’m sick and tired of being anxious about my friend’s responses all the time when it’s most likely nothing. When people do reply after me overthinking and practically killing myself over it, I get this small high if dopamine. I wait a little to respond and to me, the notification of the text looks so satisfying to me, so I have this thing where I wait to respond so I won’t seem weird. Even when I’m busy doing things, I’m still thinking about the responses. I noticed it’s gotten worse during COVID too. Pre-COVID, I wouldn’t overthink responses nor care whether people even responded to me or not. Now that I’ve been on my phone and other gadgets more often with COVID, I’ve gotten worse with overthinking responses. I hate that I have. I just want to go back to when I didn’t care about whether people really responded or not. I miss that. How do I go back to that?-nan-Hello, friends. Many of you guys have seen me constantly posting here. A lot of anxiety is driving me crazy and being here and sharing how I feel with people who go through the same, makes me feel safe.I just checked up my blood sugar and the reader gave me a wrong reading of 42, then the correct one which was 86. Lately i’m getting anxious in anything health related (pills, illness, etc.) when I saw the 42 I started sweating, getting dizzy, and literally ran to my mother.Oh, and I also had an anxiety attack that made me stop today at a hospital (my biggest phobia is hospitals and needles) lucky me the doctor checked me up (no needles needed) and gave me something for the anxiety.Anybody on the same boat with anxiety spiking up suddenly?-Greetings. Hope you are doing well!I've had some health issues lately that have made life a bit more difficult. Work has been a lot more stressful, marriage has been stressful, and to top it off, my wife is pregnant. There is a lot going on right now.A couple weeks ago, while I was driving, my body started to get warm and tingly, my breathing almost felt like I wasn't getting enough oxygen, and I felt just uneasy overall. I thought I had having another stroke initially but it was full body and only lasted a few minutes with no other stroke-like symptoms.I talked to my therapist about it. She thinks I had a panic attack. I tend to agree. She gave me a couple techniques to try but we haven't gotten around to discussing meds yet.Sorry if I'm rambling but I have these couple questions.1) Does it sound like I had a panic attack?2) Can you have a panic attack randomly? As in you aren't in a particularly stressful situation but you have panic attack symptoms anyway?I'm going to ask my doc about meds maybe. It's hard to decipher whether what's going on is related to mental health or the stroke I had or an oncoming stroke or the heart issues I have. It's all overwhelming.-I realize that this is an odd question, but I've been doing some soul-searching lately. Specifically when it comes to my self in relation to my depression and anxiety. I apologize If I'm overthinking this. I try and recognize the intrusive thoughts as a separate entity and depression as something happening to me. However, it doesn't seem that clear-cut. I realize that the internal dialogue is a different voice from the real me, but at the same time I also feel like to some extent these thoughts are part of me. Sometimes I sort of feel like there's a possibility that these thoughts are just what I want to do or say. When I'm talking to people I care about and I can hear my brain yelling spiteful or violent comments, but maybe that's just how I truly feel? Maybe I'm actually super cynical, angry and pretty unpleasant. My actions don't reflect that, but possibly I'm acting how I think I'm supposed to, rather than just being me. Maybe we're all naturally violent or hateful but norms and values keep this at bay? Maybe I exhaustively think about this because I care, but at the same time this internal conflict keeps going. Like I'm split in two. I can't decide which me is actually me.  All I know is that I've dug myself into a bit of a hole.-Hello everyone. I have been having anxiety attacks and I want to know how to stop them.It first started last year when I was in school and having chest pain. I googled and convinced myself that I was having a full blown heart attack and thought I was dying and that gave me an anxiety attack.Didn’t have any for a while until about 2 months ago where I convinced myself I had diabetes, this made me have an anxiety attack too. (I did not have diabetes)About a month ago, I had pain and convinced myself that I was having a stroke. This sent me into a such a bad anxiety attack that my mom got scared and carried me to the hospital.Last night I had a headache and subsequently convinced myself that I was having a brain aneurysm. I then had an anxiety attack that I was dying.Logically I know that i’m fine, but I still start panicking and I still think i’m going to die. Why do I keep doing this? How do I stop?-TRIGGER WARNING: discussion of imagined injury to infants in the section with asterisks.First, to be clear, my parents take good care of me and don’t hurt me, but I can’t be around them. It’s all mental and emotional. My mom has an unspecified mood disorder, probably  Bipolar, and my dad is easily angered/depressed. They used to fight almost every night, but it’s less frequent now since my dad stopped drinking. However, when my mom gets really upset she will scream that she wants a divorce or that she’s going to move back to Costa Rica by herself. That happen this morning. A while later I was watching tv with my dad.********We were watching a car commercial and started talking about car safety. He told me how a woman was holding a baby in the back of a car against her chest with the seatbelt over the baby. He proceeded to graphically talk about what would happen to the baby if a car accident happened. I was like “please don’t describe it like that”.  He kinda laughed and KEPT DOING IT. I told him firmly to stop and he described something truly horrific happening to a baby that I won’t repeat here. ********      He laughed at how upset I was getting. This happens sometimes. He think it’s so fucking funny to make me upset. My mom was in the other room and started laughing as i began to cry and yell at my dad to stop. I was standing there crying and both of them were just laughing. I felt so humiliated. Das was like “why are you upset? It didn’t really happen”  My mom was like “you’ve been really sensitive today. go take a nap”. (something happened with my mom too before that I’ll get to it later). I lost it and screamed at my dad “DON’T FUCKING TALK TO ME”.  I never ever scream the way I did then, but I was furious. I began to hyperventilate and ran into my room. I was losing it at this point. I’ve had anxiety attacks before but this was different. I just started shrieking while I was crying. I put my face down on my desk and just wailed and hyperventilated.       The only ever time I had a reaction like that was a few months ago when I got into an argument with my mom. I wanted to hurt myself and tried to call the suicide hotline, then my mom knocked on the door and I started screaming cause I thought she was gonna try to spank me or yell at me more. (I ended up going to a psychiatric hospital for 5 days) I can ’t believe my parents did this to me. They were so disrespectful of my feelings I couldn’t believe it. My teen brother is a real one though, he didn’t laugh at all and hugged me when I was crying. A lot of other shit happened before that too, this was just the last straw I guess. I’ll leave a comment with more details.    I usually keep my parents at arms length because my mom is bipolar and my dad is super conservative and doesn’t like most of the things I like. Lately, though, I was trying to get closer them cause “family is forever” or whatever people say. That’s down the drain now. I don’t hate them, but I’d like to get away from them ASAP. It’s not like they abuse me. They love me and take care of me 90% of the time. It’s just so many little things that have piled up over the years. My parents argue all the time. Also, and this is a big one, I am trans and neither of them would accept me if they knew. I have every right to believe that if I started medically transitioning they would have nothing to do with me.tldr; today a lot of things happened and pushed me over the edge. I want to move out ASAP. I don’t have money, but I graduated high school in spring and i have a car and a learners permit. I’m thinking that if I get can manage to works two fast food/retail job I’ll be out of the house for a much longer time and I’ll make more money so I can move out ASAP. Also, I don’t have any friends I can stay with.Any advice for me to be able to leave faster would be appreciated.-Anyone have health anxiety? I’ve had a lump in my left thigh for awhile now. Probably 5+ years. It’s firm, doesn’t move, seems like it’s slowly growing. I’ve had a few doctors feel it and look at it but never seemed too concerned. I made the mistake of Googling and everything popped up about sarcomas (cancer) and the more I read about it the more I’m convinced I have it. I asked my doctor about an MRI and they said they don’t think it’s necessary. My doctor referred me to physical therapy instead. (I have no idea why) But doctor thinks maybe it’s scar tissue or something to do with the fascia. I’m wondering if I should see another doctor or a specialist. I can’t stop worrying about it. The anxiety this is causing is absolutely awful.-For the past 4 months my life been full of anxiety and depression and stress since my dog passed away. Last Sunday I thought I had a heart attack while I was at my mothers house, but apparently it turned out and anxiety attack. I have never experienced anything like this before my heart was racing I felt my arms and my legs tingling and numb I was shacking uncontrollably. After going to ER they got my blood work and X-ray and EKG they didn’t find anything wrong. I went back home and I felt the same way again. After 3 days my stomach started to hurt me a lot like everything I eat and doesn’t digest well and I have a gassy stomach and my throat or esophagus burns. I also have a darker spots on my stool but I take Iron supplements so I associate it with that and I also get externe cramps and my life side below my rips it hurts so bad when I touch it. I get scared when I go places now thinking the anxiety attack will happen again. What should I do I’m always scared that I have something or a health issues every time I feel something I freak out and I start googling stuff to see if what I’m feeling is normal. I just need an advice idk what to do. I’m always in fear about my health I feel like I have some many diseases and cancers in my body and I can’t stop thinking about it.-So i just got a roommate who’s very outgoing and pretty straight forward about stuff. we often hang out, smoke, drink, etc together. She’s been always telling me to stop saying sorry so much and that i need more confidence. Apparently her friends agree as well, that saying sorry so much makes me too nice and that ppl will walk all over me. I already knew this but it’s so hard to not say sorry for everything, i just feel like i’m the issue for everything. like we were at a club last night and i just got so anxious i had to leave and i feel bad bc they helped me a lot but if i wasn’t socially anxious i wouldn’t be having these issues. like i want to have self confidence, i want to stop thinking i’m ugly and annoying but it’s so hard. ppl don’t realize that having toxic parents/childhoods really fuck you up-I have a dentist appointment in a few days and its been causing me SO much stress. I've been having issues falling and staying asleep, all my dreams are dental nightmares, my memory is horrible to the point where I can't recall the previous day and often think IRL events were dreamt up. My eating habits are fucked too, I'll either go too long without an appetite, or I'll binge to the point of pain and nausea without really realizing it.Heres the problem though. The dentist is SUPER nice, I'm only getting a single cavity filled, I'm not scared of the numbing needle, and I dont have any issue with metal in my mouth. I truly don't have any of the generic dentist fears of like gagging, or fingers in mouth, or numbing needles, or whatver it is. I'm barely living from anxiety but I don't fear the dentist and I dont know what the fuck is causing this anxiety. I know its 100% this appointment causing me anxiety, but  theres nothing about the appointment that's logically scary to me... So like wtf?-has anyone else found it hard to work (a job) w their anxiety? work can be exhausting as is, and it’s even more so when you’re in your head all day and beating yourself up. the physical symptoms make the time even more unbearable. i find that naturally, my anxiety is ofc worse when starting a job, since that’s the time where anyone would have anxious feelings. but my problem is, it carry’s much longer into the course of work, and i will begin overthinking things i’ve been doing for months. im really bad with talking to people as well, which creates a even worse work environment for me. i quit my last job months ago bc the training wasn’t helpful for me and i was too scared to say anything. i didn’t want to feel inadequate. i ghosted the boss and never returned to work.i’ve been unemployed for months, and i’m so scared to begin working again. i find that the stress of my anxiety also causes me to disassociate and completely lose my concept of time. although im only 18 and a soon to be full time college student, i beat myself up for being unemployed. life revolves around work and that’s something i feel incapable of doing.-Is it anxiety if I feel uncomfortable with an upset stomach when I sit down to chill with my friends. We normally play poker and drink. Now I just can't stand alcohol as it makes my situation worse. My immediate response is to leave them and escape.-I really enjoy taking pre workout but I can’t handle the amount of anxiety that the caffeine gives me after. The same thing goes with smoking weed. I’m never anxious about anything in particular but my heart always races so fast and I just feel too panicked to do anything productive. Does anybody have any advice with how to deal with this?-(long post) (TW sickness,vomiting)This phobia started when I was around 12 and I heard a story of a woman who got food poisoning from potato salad or something from Costco. She ended up being in the hospital for over a week and nearly dying. And even without having to go to the hospital, it sounds like the most horrific sickness. Extreme stomach pain and sickness, vomiting and diarrhea all terrify me way more than other types of being hurt/sick. I would rather break my arm than then have food poisoning. I’ve never gotten really sick from food (knock on wood), but the idea haunts me. I had a panic attack once when I cooked chicken tenders for myself because I thought it was undercooked/spoiled, even thought the meat was fine and I checked the internal temperature like 5 times. My dad talked some sense into me and for like 5 years I don’t really think about it.   The fear resurfaced recently, probably because I listened to a podcast and they started talking about how sick they all got from fast food pizza. Now the idea is stuck in my mind. It’s just the fact that it’s happens to so many people, and that it can come from basically ANYTHING. Greens have E. coli. Meat and eggs have salmonella. Canned things can have botulism. Who knows if this lunch meat was handled properly? Am I REALLY sure that the groceries are still safe, even though it was only in the trunk for an hour?    I cook for myself mostly, but that seems to make the fear a lot worse. (But now I am suspicious of restaurants as well.) I used to have no fear about what I ate, but now I have to sniff everything to make sure it isn’t sour. Am I sure that this sandwich meat isn’t old? Am I sure that this lettuce doesn’t have E.coli in it. (I love Taco Bell, actually, but cross my heart I will never step foot into a Chipotle in my life. Like over 100 people got actual food poisoning from that place why the fuck do people go there )  Last night and this morning I used salad greens that were wilty and kinda wet but still 4 days away from expiring. “Prewashed” but I still rinsed them. I ate a sandwich with the greens and meat that I sniffed and tasted to make sure it was safe. But as soon as my stomach gurgled/started settling, it’s like a switch flips in my brain and I start thinking “oh god this is it. Its gonna hurt so so bad. I have e. Coli. Oh god the meat /was/ off. What if I I have to go to the hospital??” I started panting and my hands got clammy. Last night, I forced myself to vomit and kept hyperventilating. Every little feeling I had in my stomach was a sure sign that something I ate was bad.     I calmed down and thought “oh wait it’s not that bad.” But even hours later, if I have any kind of pain in my stomach I get freaked out again. (I really screwed myself over once I read online that it can hit you up to 15 hours later.) I’m in the bathroom now and my stomach is hurting again. I ate breakfast about 2 hours ago. Trying not to cry. I’m so terrified of the pain that could be coming.TLDR. How do I prevent myself from getting sick? What can I do to reassure myself that I won’t be sick now or later? I don’t want to live my life this way. Any help is appreciated.-I have been anxious since about 2016. I developed palpitations, skipped beats, and some scary episodes with my heart rate, and that has developed into this major obsession and anxiety disorder that got a million times worse with the pandemic.I have been depressed only during the winter months, and I was still very functional. For a while, even with this amount of anxiety, I've stayed positive, hopeful, and very excited about getting this over with, but now it's scary. My anxiety is very crippling. I am obsessed with my heart. That it's going to beat too fast, fall out of rhythm, stop, etc. This means I can't experience anxiety or excitement without getting even more anxious.I have tried therapy, reading books, deep breathing, meditation, exposure, etc. but I'm so TIRED! So exhausted. I gave in and started Zoloft, but I'm worse. I know these things are supposed to make you feel worse before you feel better, but I can't take it. I can't take even 1% increase in anxiety right now. I cannot do it any longer. I just want to escape these feelings. If medication, which was my last attempt to fix this doesn't work, then what else is there? I can't keep suffering and being a burden.I am fucking EXHAUSTED.-I was hospitalized last week, took a cbd supplement that was laced with THC without my knowledge. I react very poorly to edible thc. I ended up in the hospital with Supra ventricular tachycardia and extreme paranoia, numbness, and dizziness and shortness of breath. I missed work the day after and left work early the day after that. Now I feel so panicky, anxious, and I’ll I don’t even think I can go in tomorrow. I’m a vet tech so I have to be “on” and alert at work and I’m not at all. I haven’t been sleeping. I can tell my boss was annoyed I left early on Friday. I can’t really tell her the reason I’ve been out cause it sounds like I got stoned and just decided to miss work. The product was purchased from a store marketed by the associate as CBD. I’m having constant panic attacks and depersonalization episodes from the trauma of the experience. I had come so far in healing from anxiety now I’m back at square 1. I’m crushed-I’ve never dated or kissed anyone before and I feel like I’m really behind on the dating game. I have some matches on dating apps and I want to ask to meet up in person, but I know once I initiate it my anxiety is going to be terrible the whole time leading up to the date. I take propranolol to lower my heart rate but I still can’t stop the feeling of dread I always have. I’m also nervous because I’m inexperienced and scared my dates would be turned off by that. Any advice would be appreciated.-So I’ve never been a good sleeper. When I was younger I got a sleep study done that showed I have restless leg syndrome so I wake up a lot. I have a really hard time falling asleep now, a lot of that is attributed to my anxiety. My doctor prescribed me hydroxyzine to help with my anxiety and insomnia. The issue is whenever I take it, I cannot wake up in the morning. I feel exhausted and the other day I slept for 12 hours. Has anyone else experienced this? What did you do to help it? should I just take it way earlier?-Hello! I’m a 20 year old female. I have severe social anxiety. I went shopping for about an hour or so today and got anxiety while being out. I noticed that my legs get incredibly shaky and sometimes hurt during an anxiety attack. I still currently have lingering calf muscle pain in my left leg and sometimes pain in my right leg. I have a tendency to overthink about my health as well, so I am worried that I have a blood clot or something crazier happening besides just a sore calf muscle. Has anyone had lingering pain in their calf muscles from anxiety? It really worries me because i’m also on Nexplanon, the birth control implant and I just had a new one inserted about 3 days ago. Birth control has those risk factors of blood clots, and it really as me worried. If anybody can relate to lingering muscle cramping in their lower legs, please feel free to respond. Also, if anybody has any tips on how to relieve this particular calf pain, I would appreciate it as well. I already took a magnesium and D3 vitamin that is said to help muscle cramps. Thank you!-Well, I think I am dealing with anxiety a long time ago but the last two weeks have been a completely  nightmare. I can't stop crying, I feel guilty about everything, Im constantly scared to do something wrong... Etc. I am with a therapist and helps me a lot but these last few weeks I have been going through a lot and I can no longer control what is happening to me. I told her that I felt the anxiety was becoming unbearable but she didn't say anything about medication, just to drink tea. Should I tell her explicitly that I want medication? Is it a good idea to take them?-nan-Send help-I usually can down a big meal without worry but for a few weeks Iv felt like it’s gotten harder to even eat half a meal, heck it’s gotten hard to swallow the food. I usually just force myself to swallow now because if I don’t eat I’d be worse off but idk why this is happening and why it’s been happening for so long nowNot to mention how my stomach hurts every time I eat and my pooping habits seem to have changed, almost like I’m stopped up-I was just wondering how people \"turn it off\" effectively, and if there is such a thing, and how to do it. I'm in my first year of university, just broke it off with someone I was seeing, and am overwhelmed with financial burdens and challenges. I know it's really important to blow off steam, to \"turn it off\", to relax in different ways but for me my tried and true methods don't even work anymore. I used to game, lift weights, smoke, drink, enjoy a movie or TV show, or jump into a cold shower - I always had these things I could do to make myself \"turn it off\". Whatever it was I was made uneasy by I could relax into the normalcy of these pass times. I think a lot of it may be heightened due to finally returning to my education and remote learning and  being able to do work anywhere anytime continuously also puts pressure on you anywhere anytime that you should be working. Covid makes your house life and your school life inseparable. I haven't been able to turn it off or enjoy things or find peace for a long time, and even those things that I build up in my head as these sure-fire go to's whenever I wanna feel okay don't work. Is it something physical? Is the stress too much for my regular practices? Am I doing something wrong? Why do the things I used to do to blow of steam not work anymore, and what can I do in their place? Thx-For a few short weeks I was able to ignore my anxiety and it seemed to work but outta nowhere for the past two days, Iv been afraid of death, thought of every health condition that could kill me, have so many feelings of pain and stuff and tired and abdominal pain. I can’t even keep my eyes open that much.Yet every time I check my body for a heart issue I find nothing, every time I look for symptoms I find none, it’s getting bad and j need help-I recently get a puzzle box from Barnes & Nobles (I'd post a video of it but unfortunately this sub doesn't allow those type of posts) and it's been very helpful during stressful moments. Obviously I'm not sure how effective it would be during a full blown panic attack, but it helped during the day to keep my mind off the stupid little things that I tend to turn into major reasons to start to panic. It's a nice little box that folds into different shapes and it makes a very satisfying noise when it locks into place. I also got a tiny game remote with a bunch of buttons, a joystick, and some other little trinkets that you can fidget with. I def reccomend finding a little trinket you can fidget with to carry with you throughout your day, it helped me a lot and I'm glad I found this :) hope it helps someone else-Basically its been almost 4 weeks since we have been back in school since the summer holidays and I have hardly done any of the work for one of my subjects and I barely know the teachers so I'm really anxious and nervous to go up to them and tell them  my reasons.And I really don't want to get kicked out of the 6th form I go to for not completing my work.So I'm thinking of telling my problems to this other perosn who is not a teacher of mine for that subject but he is like the assistant head of house  for the 6th form I  go to and I've had him as a teacher before so I'm more comfortable telling him my problems.Basically my reason for not doing the work is bascially a close family member of mine who I loved  very much died during the holidays and I thought that I could just go back to school and do my work and just be like I was before the holidays and before this family member died but it as turned out to be harder than I thought going back to school acting like nothing happened or acting like I'm fine or that I can still do my work.And I also have some other personal problems that have affected me and my capabilities in doing my work but that family member dying is one if the biggest things that have affected my work quality.Idk. What do you guys think I should do.-I work in a high demand field at a technology company. I have a team that reports to me and a laundry list of projects cycling through all the time.Today, I'm paralyzed by what this week will bring me. Quarter end with two huge presentations that I'm unprepared for in front of the CEO and exec staff just this week alone. Big code releases with my stamp of approval, etc etc. Ugh. Combined with my family relying on me to provide, I feel like I'm slowly suffocating.The sleepless nights, constant debilitating anxiety and panic episodes are too much for me to bear anymore. I need to speak up and say something but I'm terrified that it'll backfire and I'll lose career momentum. These aren't the kind of people you show weakness to. What the hell have I gotten myself into?Working around these seemingly-confident executives has made feel like the problem is with me, but I'm starting to ask myself if I want any of this. I need time to decompress and reassess. I'm feeling compelled to ask for a week off for a mental health break just so I can stop and breathe, but I'm sheepishly fearing the stigma of it.Anyway, thanks for the space to rant. I love you all, thank you for making me feel slightly less alone in all of this. Please wish me luck tomorrow.-Every sundays makes me demotivated and working on homeworks make me feel very anxious. Except if I have a very close deadline and don't have a choice, I've never really managed to get much done on that day.Is it the same for anyone else? I'm just wondering if I'm alone in feeling that way or if it is common.-I am a bit nervous of the outcome, but I am quitting my job due to anxiety. I have struggled with GAD, OCD, and vomiting problems for years and I want to just work on myself. It was my first ever job and it was in retail. I was doing well when I began, but I started having more and more frequent anxiety and panic attacks and it has gotten to the point where I throw up every day before work, multiple times a day. When I get anxious I throw up over and over for days in a row; even at the same times every day.I want to find a medication that works right for me so I can get my life back. I want to get more frequent therapy. I want to be able to regain the weight that I have been rapidly shedding. I want to find happiness in myself and my hobbies again.&#x200B;I just wanted to throw this out there. I am feeling a mixture of regret and hope.-Hey guys! I am I’m on the back end of a big anxiety stint (thank god). Though I am still avoiding places where I have had anxiety attacks, for example I have some streets I don’t drive down any more, I am still frightened to walk on the beach for a long period of time and now I’m beginning to have anxiety when I am going on my morning jog.The beach and the streets don’t bother me, as I’m not a beach person and I can drive other ways to work. I am just really disappointed now I feel it when on my morning run. I love running, it clears my head and makes me feel really good and is my way of keeping in shape. I have attributed the anxiety to sensory overload when I’m running, there is usually a lot of people around, a lot of noises and smells. I do not suffer social anxiety though *** I see a psychologist and she has said to feel the thoughts that come in my head and say reassuring statements, to ground myself by focusing on my feet hitting the ground as I run. I find this all too overwhelming and usually end up calling someone as my escape route (this always makes me feel better).I need some advice on what I can do, I don’t want to feel like this every time I go to the place where I run in the mornings, I am worried that even if I change location it will be the same result and anyway I love the place that I run and I don’t want to stop going there altogether.Usually when I run I will listen to music up until I feel anxious than call someone or I will switch to a podcast. This morning even though I was on the phone to someone I was just too overwhelmed and had to turn back.-Ive been experiencing something that is so hard to explain. Ive been to the doctor twice about it and they say its my sinuses. But it just seems like they are guessing. They dont do any tests. I cant even describe it properly to them. So whats happening is: my eyes feel \"weird.\" I ALMOST feel dizzy, but not quite. Its the most intense when im in the woods. It almost feels like my eyes are trying to take it all in, but i cant. Its ALMOST like i cant focus, but i can. It also makes me feel like my eyes are heavy, and my mouth wants to frown, like it feels weak, or something. Going on a walk almost puts me in a bad mood, because of the stress of this feeling, while walking. Im like trying to look at everything, but it just feels WEIRD. God this sounds so ridiculous. how am i supposed to get help if i cant even explain it? I do have anxiety. I do have \"health anxiety\" but i felt like ive been controlling it, and it seems to still be there. I feel the best first thing in the morning. rarely, some days i feel fine. It also get worse when i smoke weed. I stopped smoking weed. I try to search the internet, i try to talk to doctors. I just cant explain it fully! i say \" i feel  slightly dizzy\" or \" my eyes dont properly focus\" but both of those arent true, its just the only way i can put it into human words, lol. I guess this is anxiety related? hoping to see if any one can relate. love-My anxiety is at it's worst for some reason when I'm travelling in a car and my parents are forcing me to go on a 30-40 min car journey next week with no say in the matter. I can barely go on 5 minute journeys without breaking down from anxiety attacks and I'm left an emotional wreck for a few days or so after that. Any advice on how to make it as smooth as possible would be much appreciated. Thanks.-TW: i'm describing panic attack symptoms and anxietySo i've been struggling with very bad anxiety and panic attacks for about 8 yrs now, i'm in therapy and on meds though so yeah, everything more or less ok. I mainly get anxiety from being overwhelmed and stress. So today i (f/19) got into an anxiety attack like state after overhearing my parents talk/argue about getting divorced, it was really just a very stressful, overwhelming and sad situation for me. I felt my whole body cramping up and shaking and i teared up. Later, i talked to my brother and i just couldnt concentrate at all, he had to repeat every sentence at least 3 times. I wasnt panicking anymore or anything, it just seemed like my brain had shut down. I had a song in my head (like normal yk) and all of a sudden, it just became so loud i couldnt hear anything anymore, i zoned out completely, it was like passing out for a few seconds. I also still feel as if i hear everything through a thin wall of cotton. I never experienced this before. Does anyone know what this is/had this happen to them before?-Hello, for the ones who are diagnosed with IBS and who notice their symptoms are worse when they are anxious, did therapy help you with controlling your symptoms better? And if you can, please tell me what was your symptoms. For me my primary symptom is nausea ( rarely I actually throw up from it) and sometimes diarrhea. I am actually more worried about the fact that I’m in public and this actually makes it worse. I also have this irrational fear that if I don’t throw up right away I will aspirate in my lungs and die. Please help, anything helps!-I constantly have something on my mind and im starting to think i have anxiety. as stupid as it sounds i can convince myself that im THE worst at something and it seems so believable. either i think im the worst looking, the dumbest, the shittest at a sport, the most anti social, that im hated by everyone and etc.its so much fucking bs cuz i cant ever let my guard down since whenever i do these thoughts get louder. the past few months i hadnt had many thoughts like that so i started relaxing, now that ive started uni and imin a new city where i barely know anyone and the people around me arent my type of people i constantly have new shit on my mind.how do i avoid letting myself spiral down with a thought.-Iv got a serious infection in my body an my anxiety is trough the roof.The doctors don't know what it is yetAny helpful tips?-So my normal working shifts are Monday, Wednesday and Saturday. Last week asked me if I could come in on Sunday and I said sure. I checked the schedule multiple times and I assumed that the 9-2 on Sunday they wrote down was just temporary because they never told me it was permanent. And now I had to speak to the owner (who isn't the nicest) and explain why I couldn't come in (which was because I had a family outing planned today) its only been like my 1 first week or so and I am a teen. Any advice? I dont think I'll get fired but probably won't be seen as the nicest? I'm really anxious right now.-Guys I've done it, I've booked some therapy. I sat down with my partner tonight and we looked through loads of different options, what I want/need, and what kind of therapy would be best for me. I've narrowed it down to 4 people, who I've emailed and I'm now waiting to hear back from them and see which one I'm drawn too. I'm nervous, excited and everything in between. I hope this will be the answer to everything I've been feeling over these last few years, and help me to finally feel like my old self again. I never realised how deep into this I got, and honestly, I don't like it.I cannot wait to start this journey, and I'm honestly so lucky to have such a supportive partner by my side helping me through this journey. (To clarify, my partner isn't forcing therapy or anything on me, it's 100% been my decision).-So it’s my first day at uni tomorrow, I’m 19 and from the UK. I left my old course (which was all online) and took a year off to work on myself but pretty much done nothing for the year. I’ve been out with friends and I’ve started learning to drive which have boosted my confidence which is good. However I’m just concerned about tomorrow as I don’t know anyone and I’m not very good at talking and making friends Most of the people on my course have done a foundation year and seems like they have already made friendships, not to mention that I missed fresher week because I was on holiday putting me at a disadvantage. Anyone have any good advice out there? I know a lot of people probably suffer more than me and it’s nice knowing I’m not the only one.-I think we can all agree that anxiety produces lots of symptoms that feel very very real and serious. What are your best tips and strategies for telling those apart from real situations or calming yourself down and snapping ourself out of the anxiety?In my personal case I always worry that if I dismiss a symptom it’s gonna be the one time it’s something real or serious. How do you overcome that thought or know ok this is the real deal vs anxiety?-Lost my last job just before Christmas and spent the time since searching. I've finally landed an apprenticeship in an office role which I've never worked in before (I used to work in education) and I'm incredibly anxious. Last few days I've felt it creeping in, standard worries of what if I'm bad at the job, what if I don't get on with my co-workers and with unemployment/pandemic I also just haven't interacted with people a whole much so it's getting back in the swing of things. In the same vein there is also excitement of the potential to find a role I thrive in, make some new friends and generally get into a healthy routine of actually doing things beyond endlessly applying for jobs. I am bricking it, I am anxious but got to go into this head on. Most of the fears are and will be purely fabricated by my own mind so it's about kicking them to the curb. Having said that if any of you want to send good vibes my way I'd appreciate that too!  Have a cracking Sunday - hopefully tomorrow goes great and for any of you guys dreading or worrying about tomorrow, you've got this. You can smash it out of the park!-I have recently moved to London and finding it really difficult to get settled. I love the house but I'm still getting used to all the new noises of the property and feel extremely anxious and on edge all the time to the point where I'm struggling to go about my day as usual. It's been a bit of a difficult move (across far across country, problems sorting the hygiene of one of the rooms, no internet for a long time). I think I'm really sensitive to noise due to some nightmare neighbors from the previous house. Does anyone have any suggestions or tips to make my days more bearable? How do I settle in and stop feeling so dreadful? I feel sick and constantly have dreadful heart palpitations.-Every time I sleep, be it a nap, night or whatever, when I wake up, I'm extra anxious for 15-30min, then it gradually gets better. It's like I have to learn how to be human again, lol. This even happens if I'm on benzos (though not as drastic).I have no clue why this is, I can't correlate it to anything. Anyone else experience this?It perplexes me and I hate it.-I recently got into university and as someone who has severe social anxiety I’ve always found it hard to make new friends, especially groups of friends.  I feel like every second I fail to interact with others their social circle starts to close up.  I keep missing opportunities to include myself and now they’re slowly starting to stay with people better than me.  I had the same problem throughout high school and ended up with barely any friends left and severe depression.  I don’t know if I can handle another 4 years without ending it.-I am a busy full-time professional and taking a grad. class plus I have a five year old. Been dealing with and managing my gen. anxiety for a few years now. I’ve had a cold this week and today woke up feeling very bad after 12 hours of sleep. I don’t have my child today and my only obligation is writing a short 2 page paper before tomorrow. I went back to sleep and slept for 3 more hours. I now feel a bad anxious and guilty feeling. Does anyone else feel like this? Why do I feel guilt when I’ve done absolutely nothing wrong and have harmed no one. Quite frankly I probably even helped myself as it seems I needed the rest. I don’t like this feeling as it makes me feel like I’ve done something wrong.-I'm taking Lexapro, it was good at first with the 20mg. But now I feel depression creeping back up and don't feel like doing anything. I haven't cleaned my appointment in a month and a half.-Ive been driving for a month now and I feel like shit. I make so many mistakes while driving. Most days it’s just small mistake that i doubt anyone will notice like I turned too wide. Or I’m going a little too slow a little too fast. But I feel like shit when I do them. It is mentally exhausting. I’m still trying to cope with it. How do you guys do it?-I don’t know what I’m looking for in posting this but I want to anyway. I am 27f, a bit overweight but otherwise healthy and active. Since I was in high school I’ve had manageable anxiety, no panic attacks ever, just typical anxieties day to day that I could usually quiet through meditation or exercise. On Sept 14, I had a full fledged panic attack and thought my heart was going to stop, my husband took me to the hospital where I was told it was anxiety and that my heart and everything else was fine. I was also given a prescription for Xanax, .5mg, that I have since taken 4 pills of. Since that first panic attack on the 14th I have had daily panic attacks lasting for hours, sometimes all night long. All of these attacks revolve around me thinking my heart is about to give out or that I’m going to stop breathing. That worry coupled with the physical symptoms of anxiety(shortness of breath and rapid heart rate) are keeping me in this state of constant fear and panic. I went to my regular doctor yesterday and she told me that I’m basically in perfect health and that made me feel better when I was in the office but the moment I left the panic set back in. I guess I’m looking for reassurance. The fact that this has set on so suddenly and nothing has been able to mitigate it is keeping me in that state of worry. I haven’t been able to go to work or really even go outside because I’m so scared. Nothing in my life has changed to trigger this anxiety. Has anyone else had this happen to them? I’m sorry for any spelling or grammar errors…anxiety.-This is a wonderful new thing I've developed . Its really frustrating me . I know that insomnia is typically temporary but lately every night I'm having legit panic attacks over not being able to fall asleep which will keep me up. It doesn't help that I'm hella jet lagged ( La to Barcelona). I just wanted to tell someone. Thanks for reading .-My throat feels slightly itchy is it allergies? Dust? Or  something worse Who knows but im panicking-Have anyone experienced unilateral tremors with sporadic headaches now and then with Anxiety on the left side of the head mainly?other times it would feel like a tight band on around the forehead(does not happen frequently)-There's an instinctive feeling inside of me that i cannot do it, even though I know I'm a capable and intelligent person. I don't know if I've ever really tried as a result as I tend to just abandon things/rationalize not pursuing then further, even though I worry about and desire to achieve something so much. (also have a lot of traits of adhd/hyperactivity) Any advice / insights you can share on this? Thank you!-Hello everyone! I have been a Hypochondriac for a while… always googling my symptoms and believing I have it…. Long story short, in August I tried some edibles and a few hours later had my first ever panic attack… went to the hospital as I thought I had a stroke or something… they told me was a panic attack, and it continued every few days until about 2 weeks ago… since last month, I still feel parathesia around my body(tingles,burning etc). Even went to a Neurologist who conducted all the tests :( can symptoms last this long after panic attacks, and when my body was high on anxiety? I am still googling symptoms and coming up with new problems… 🥺 right now I am having jaw issues(TMJ), headaches, tense muscles and tingling and parathesia all over my body… was diagnosed by my Neuro with BFS(Benign Fesiculation Syndrome), as some of my body just twitches randomly..-Am struggling with anxiety the last week due to a tinnitus flare up. I’ve also become sensitive to low-moderate level safe decibel noise in a way I never have been. It’s freaking me out and I’m likely still 10+ days from seeing a doctor unless my appointment gets moved up. A total of 20 days between onset of symptoms and seeing doctor. Seems like a long time and Ifeel like time is running short. Meanwhile, anxiety has come back full force worrying I’m losing hearing, on the verge of going fully deaf, etc. I’ve been very thirsty no matter how much I drink. I’ve also had very little appetite and basically force myself to eat. When eating mouth becomes very dry and swallowing is hard, almost like my body is trying to reject food. Why is this?-My head seems to feel woozy and a little lightheaded/dizzy often. I get allot of tension headaches back of my neck/head temples and eyes. When the headache isn’t there i still think the tension is still there lingering. Maybe that’s what is making my head feel the way it does. When i go out for walks or shops or anything like that my head feels like it’s on another plant, when i close my eyes it feels like my head is working 1000 miles an hour if you get me prob giving me that slight dizzy feeling. Looking to go on tablets tomorrow so hopefully it’ll get better and i also start my CBT soon too. Felt this way for years makes me not want to go out. I suffer bad with health anxiety, socials anxiety and just GAD in general-My anxiety prevents me from working and getting a job. I’m 20 and have never had a job. Not having a job was never a problem since I was always active in sports that consumed 6-7 days of each week, so I never had the opportunity. In the summers, I still would row and go to regattas but I also loved having time away from school and sports in the summer and used that time for vacations and having fun. I’m now in my sophomore year of college and have only 2 in person classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays, the rest I opted for online. I have a lot of down time that I try to fill with seeing my boyfriend but he also works, so it’s not always as much as I’d want to. I already miss him a lot when we’re apart so I know I need to be more proactive. I’ve started back at the gym a bit which was hard and still is but I want to get into a groove and be healthier, body and mind. In august, I got my first job at a gym at the front desk and working with kids. It was okay and my anxiety was very prevalent, but I managed the best I could. I ended up quitting after a week after having a male coworker constantly flirt and grab my waist as a way to funnily scare me, which it wasn’t at all. Instead of being upfront about my reasonings, I told my boss that I found a better job that was in my career path and needed to take it. In hindsight, I should’ve told the truth because no coworker should treat another coworker the way I was being constantly uncomfortable. This solidified my fears to not work and I just can’t see myself with a job like that yet. I’m in school to be a young kids teacher which I know won’t give me much anxiety since I love children but all the jobs available to me are ones I am not interested in and give me a lot of anxiety thinking about it. I’ve tried daycares but because I’m a student and can’t work full time, they can’t hire me. Babysitting is always too sporadic when I’d rather have a set schedule and nannying conflicts with my schooling. Right now, I would love to have a remote job since that’s all I feel I could manage right now. I know I also need to be saving money since there’s so much I want to achieve in life but I feel incapable. I’m working on improving my mental health but I know it’ll be a slow process so until then I guess a job that doesn’t require much seems the best to me.I live at home still so I’m reliant upon my parents for everything and when I’m with my boyfriend, I’m reliant on him for things too. I don’t want to feel like a burden to people anymore and I want to be more self sufficient since the plan is to rent an apartment off campus either next semester or my junior year. Since I am fortunate enough that my parents can provide that for me, I want to prove to them that I can also provide for myself and make my own money but I genuinely don’t feel ready for a real job. If anyone has any jobs that are low anxiety jobs or ones that I can start online I would greatly appreciate it!! Just needed to vent and maybe get some advice :)-I'm in the process of helping my elderly, disabled dad move. He's not allowed to bring his cat with him to where he is moving, so i am taking her.I have always been a cat lover and I've wanted a cat again for years. I've held off though because I've been raising a family and i didn't want to bring a cat home to 2 toddler girls who would absolutely love the cat, but might stress her out. She's used to living in a quiet retirement community and my house is the typical toddler household still. My girls are currently 3 and 4.I'm having a TON of anxiety over bringing the cat home. I'm worried I'm going to ruin this cats nerves. When my dad first brought her home with him all she did was hide and run from every noise. It took her months to get fully comfortable and she's still not fond of strangers. My kids aren't strangers to her, and she's ok with them when they're calm. But when the kids get rowdy the cat gets scarce.We can't find another better home for her right now. I don't feel comfortable taking her to the shelter, i love her. I've talked to my kids as much as you can about it to a 3 and 4 year old. They are excited to have her. Do you think she will adjust? She's 5 now. She likes affection. She just doesn't like noise. My house isn't that big, its just one floor of an average sized house. Do you think she will do ok? Does anybody have any tips on helping the cat adjust? Or am i overreacting because of my anxiety?-hello! i am taking 0.75mg of clonazepam daily (3/4 of a 1mg pill) along with 100mg of sertraline. My doctor prescribed me to take 0.25mg of clonazepam with each meal (3 times a day) to make the 0.75mg, but i often forget and decided to take the entire dose at night. I have never had trouble with side effects or addiction (in fact i forget to take them at all sometimes) so my question is: does the way i take my medication matter in the effect it has on me? would it be different if i did take 1/4 pill throught the day instead of all at once at night???i really hope this made sense 🤧🤧🤧 and thank you!!!-This is a bit complicated to explain, but here's an example: let's say i'm in love with this guy and he gets a girlfriend. My friends find out and tell me. Obviously i'll be hurt but if i go to his instagram and see their pictures together, it'd hurt me even more, right? So you think \"well, just don't go to their instagram then\" and that's the thing. When i start trying to avoid something that i don't wanna see, i start getting anxious about it and i have no clue why. The anxiety only goes away after i do whatever i've been avoiding. It's like my brain WANTS me to see it and get hurt so it can be at peace afterwards for some reason?? What prompted me to ask this is that youtube keeps recommending me this video about a topic that i know will get me angry (specially if i go to the comment section) so i'm avoiding it but now i'm anxious because of it. Part of me is like \"go and see it, someday you will anyway so you can just get it over with now\" but why when i can simply AVOID IT? Why won't my brain let me avoid stuff?? Does this happen with anyone else?-I met up with someone from the app bumble bff for drinks and thought we hit it off well.  He mentioned hanging out again and introducing me to people in his life.  I texted him to hang out and he didn’t answer.  This was a day ago.  I’m feeling insecure like I’m not good enough for his company.  Feel rejected and like a loser.  Anyone there to help me to chill out?-Hello!Wanted to reach out and see if anyone else has had this experience… I don’t typically have major difficulties managing my anxiety and would describe the times I get stressed and slightly anxious as “normal” reactions to a stressful job, etc. however I have had 4-5 times, starting over the last two years, had extremely severe anxiety periods lasting for several days to a week. Up most of the night, heart racing, constantly thinking about what could go wrong, etc. It usually improves once I get more sleep and I can go months and months without experiencing it again. But like I said, when I do experience it, it is above and beyond. I can barely function and am at like a 10 the whole day and night.It seems to surround transitions in my life. Anyone else have a similar experience?? Even my therapist was a little mystified that it comes and goes sporadically but so intensely.-The title says it all, been a rough few weeks and today I hit the absolute rock bottom-I started to get withdrawl last week and I mean last 2 days have gotten worse but today better they feel like they peaked within days-i've been talking to a girl on for a few days via dating app, and i'm just a mess right now.  infatuation has always been so horrible to me.  i feel on the verge of crying. and feel so pathetic.   i just feel like blocking her, because its too much.   i have told her how i feel, and she said \"well, what's the worst that can happened. we can just be friends\" but i just don't want that, and rather i didn't know her now.-So, for the last three or four days I've been having some really frustrating chest pain/pressure that only goes away when I'm completely distracted from it. It doesn't matter what I'm thinking about, if I'm not fully focused, this pressure makes itself known. I went to the ER, and they did an x-ray, EKG, blood test, etc., but they didn't find any problems and said it's likely due to my panic/anxiety disorders.The thing is though, this is pretty new to me. While I've had chest pain due to a panic attack or anxiety, it's never lasted this long, or been this bad, and it's making it even harder to function than normal.What I'm wondering is if anything has similar symptoms, and if they have any suggestions to cope or even help relieve the pain I'm feeling.(Important to note, I'm not currently on any medication other than mood stabilizers due to problems with insurance, and until that's fixed, I'm unfortunately on my own)TL;DR: Having near constant chest pain/pressure due to anxiety/panic disorder, and it isn't caused by any underlying heart problems - looking for people with similar symptoms and advice.-too much ppl, the crowd but cashiers triggers my anxiety so much. my heart goes through the roof when im checking out, sweating like balls. so i been using self checkouts but it still triggers my anxiety. all those cameras monitoring my every move. it freaks me out and gives me so much anxiety-For 24 years, I had been raised under tiger parenting, mistreated day & night. It wasn't until I resettled alone in Britain following so many blood & tears when I realize what freedom really is. Indeed, it's hard to know what freedom is unless you've lost or gained it, either way. Having grown up in a hostile environment with little love & empathy from nasty family members cost my faith in mankind. No matter how articulate I can be in normal conversations, I've never found trusting anyone easy. There always seems to be a conspiracy against me. Never has a day passed without terror. It's out of myself. I feel I'm affecting those who I deal with. I'm very sorry for that. I like socializing, but sometimes locking thyself in a room fares better than hanging out, doesn't it ? Girlfriend? No, never, I can never trust. Be myself is too tough & so wasting my life may be the necessary evil. I'm still 24. There are lots of g**d***ed stuff I've neither enjoyed nor had the capacity for it, have I ?-Like your stomach muscles tense up so much it hurts after awhile and you can't seem to relax it.Feeds into my health anxiety which seems to make it worse-Last night was absolutely terrifying and the first experience I’ve had with what I assume to be an anxiety attack. I came home around midnight after having some drinks with friends. I was feeling pretty tired so I took a quick shower and hopped into bed. Once in bed my mind started racing (as it usually does) so I tossed and turned a bit. I also noticed that my heart rate seemed to be a bit high (minor palpitations). I decided to get on my Reddit and mindlessly scroll since I couldn’t sleep. As I was scrolling on my phone I kept noticing my heart rate being elevated so I decided to get up and take some deep breaths. I began pacing around the room when the shit hit the fan. My heart rate kept going faster and faster and the more I tried to relax the worse it got. I began to panic so I woke my brother up (it was about 2am) thinking I might need to go to the ER. Immediately upon talking to him my HR came down to about 125 which is obviously still quite high. I spent the next 3 hours laying on the sofa and just trying to rest/relax. My heart rate for the remainder of the evening hovered around 100 BPM before eventually falling asleep. Fast forward today and I’m feeling pretty terrible. Anxiety is still high as I’m worried about last nights experience. A lot of questions going through my mind… was this purely anxiety induced or perhaps a medical issue with my heart? Is this going to happen again? Why did it happen last night for the first time if I’ve always had anxiety? Heart rate today is around 85 BPM which is within normal range but still high for me. Any advice/tips on what my next steps should be would be greatly appreciated. I’ve always had what I would describe as “manageable anxiety.” I’ve never taken medication for anxiety.-I have a flight tomorrow and I already know how much hell it will be. I wish I could wake up one day and just be able to fly like a normal person. I can’t eat, I can’t sleep, and my heart is racing like crazy. Anyone else suffer with terrible anxiety while flying?-I researched it and 1) I already have a heart rhythm problem so I should *not* be taking this... I told my Dr about my heart already so this has lost some belief on them2) if one month I don't have the money, I fucking die?Goddamn this medicine has caused me anxiety. I guess I will call tomorrow and tell them I'm not taking this. I stopped over a week ago but I just have not not called yet. I just feel discouraged-Hiii everyone, i’ve been struggling with an intense fear of falling asleep. Its been bad lately vomiting and panic attacks when i do start to get tired. Any advice?? :( thank you- Dr suggested I try clonidine as him and I suspect I may have ADHD and can't afford to see a psych to get anything like a stimulant. He suggested I stop taking my propranolol (10mg 3x a day) as the Clonidine also acts as an antianxiety medication similar to propranolol. They both treat hypertension and I shouldn't be doubling up. I took the Clonidine that day and found it made me super drowsy, reminded me of a pain killer or something. Gave me a pretty good feeling but didn't seem to help my inattention at all. I'm interested in other people's experiences, does the drowsiness go away with further use? Did it make anyone else feel pretty good? Like they are on codeine or something?-I’ve been going through a “rough patch” with my anxiety and OCD especially with the intrusive thoughts. They mess me up the most because they’re things I DON’T want to do and scare the hell out of me which then causes my anxiety to turn on full force. I don’t like not feeling like me. I tend to be that happy and always laughing person and I thrive feeling that way. So, to constantly wake up and feel anxious and have my OCD throwing random intrusive thoughts in my head is terrifying. I’ve had a lot of changes since April that have been stressful. I work in veterinary medicine as a tech and we’ve been overrun and overworked lately and I’m a manager of the surgery department. People are constantly freaking out to me over issues lately. My boyfriend and I just moved into a house together in July which was a huge step. When I’ve done that in the past in relationships it’s never been a good time and I have PTSD from relationships. I don’t feel like my house is home yet. I’ve been petsitting back to back all summer and now that I’m finally home my boyfriend is traveling for work. I’m mentally drained from the pandemic I just want it to be over. My friends are all not in the best head space right now and my best friend is being super negative and dragging me down. BUT, I’ve made this changes currently. I’ve been seeing my therapist weekly for the past 6 weeks. I had an appt with my psychiatrist and he bumped up my lexapro and klonopin temporarily to help get me over this rough patch. I deleted Facebook so I wouldn’t have to see negative posts. I started a membership at a gym so I can run and work out some of this physical nervous energy I feel and stress from work. I’ve cut back on caffeine. Basically I’m just venting and want this rough patch to be over so I can go back to feeling myself again. Thanks for reading my rant if you did-Im 18 and my mother had to be taken in for a ruptured appendix yesterday and is having it done today with possibly a hysterectomy in the same anesthesia round. I couldn’t sleep at all tonight and I can’t go visit or ask considering the hospital is almost 30 miles away. Im scared out of my mind even though there haven’t been any immediate infections and her blood sugar was near perfect for the past couple of weeks. I can’t stop googling things and I feel so terribly helpless that it’s made my stomach sick. Has anyone else felt this bad?-I have a job interview in 2 days. It's perfect for me, ticks all the right boxes and would generally be a massive missed opportunity if I don't at least try. But I'm not ready. I quit my last job to get back on track with my mental health, and I haven't had enough time to get there yet. I only applied on a whim never believing I'd get an interview and now I've spent the last 4 days panicking. I have to do it or else I'll beat myself up about it and that'll get my anxiety going even more! I'm just not ready!-I am a 20 yo male, living in Europe, diagnosed with anxiety and moderate depression. I discovered my situation very recently, after a period in which an ever increasing amounts of bad thoughts started crossing my mind. I talked to my parents about this and I am now undergoing medication and counseling.I used to be very different from what I am now. I used to travel, go out with friends quite often, go study in a library, stay at home alone for a few weeks without any fears. I used to love driving, making new experiences and so much more. Now I constantly have thoughts about something bad happening. I can't stay at home without thinking that there might be thieves wanting to enter my house or someone pointing a gun at me. I can't go and drive around without fearing that if someone were to cut me off and I honk at him, he might get out of the car and hurt me. I can't go out at night even with friends, because I am afraid that if I were to cross someone's eyes they might start a fight. I can't go to the car wash without thinking that someone will want to steal my car and do so in a violent way.My situation is affecting me in so many different ways: I have a hard time studying, even though I have taken my mind off university for a whole month and I have selected courses I am really enjoying (I have never thought about leaving uni, getting a degree is just too important for me); I would love to get a motorcycle's license, but what's the point if then I am afraid to go out?; I rarely see my friends anymore and even though I explained this situation to them and my psychologist suggested to try and go out with them (which I have done very recently and I felt very well) I just can't imagine a return to a version of me without depression. I have always been anxious before taking a test or when doing something relevant for the first time, but this is way beyond anything I've ever felt. I am also extremely rational and I often read about how we're living in the safest period of human history, the world is getting safer year by year, the rate of homicides and wars is declining steadily. Reading this makes me feel good, but only for a very short period of time (minutes) whereas I used to have an extremely positive outlook about the world if I were to read the same information.Has anyone felt the same way about these topics? How long will this go on? I want to take my life back. I read a lot of posts where people are anxious about public speaking, but almost none about being anxious of people's behavior like in my case. Thanks-Today i went out to eat and as soon as i got there i got this choking, dizzy feeling. I figured i was dehydrated, but here i am 6 hours later still feeling that way. Hopefully it’s just anxiety, but it’s still annoying.-I’m having vertigo for the first time in my life. I spoke with my mom and a nurse and they both assured me I’m not going to die and take it easy and relax. I’m still feeling very scared that something is gonna happen to me. Has anyone here ever has vertigo before?? What helped?-M/26. Generalised anxiety disordepanic disordemedicated/7.5yearsSo yesterday night I was chillin, watchin movies with the boys, and movies give me pretty bad anxiety. So I was feeling really anxious. Like 7/10 and I didn’t really want to say how bad it was to the boys so I just dealt with it. But after the movies were done I needed to chill myself out and jump back in to reality. Which is usually easier said than done in my experience. I’ve read books and gone to therapy, I know a few techniques that help. Normally for me, posting on Reddit really helps but it kinda feels weird, Yknow? Like I’m being annoying for writing my thoughts and problems and posting it to the public. So anyways instead of doing that I pulled out an old note book and pen and I wrote my anxiety a letter. Sounds kinda weird but it worked. In the letter I basically told my anxiety that it’s an asshole and I’m not going to let it ruin my life. I also wrote about why I’m feeling anxious and that even though I’m struggling almost everyday I’m still not giving up no matter what. I have problems but I’m working on them. And I know that I’ll always be fine regardless of my anxiety and how shitty I feel at the time. After finishing the letter I instantly felt better. Facing my negativity and gaining control of my mind through a pen and paper worked great for me. I since then bought a journal and will continue documenting my progress and confronting my anxiety this way. I strongly recommend anyone try it. One thing I know for sure about anxiety is that words = power. Anyways that’s my rant and my advice. Hope it works for you like it did for me. Thanks for reading. ✌️😁-Whenever I go to a function, occasion. I have fun but when it ends I miss it so much for days and days I get depressed I miss all the people I met there. This makes me depressed, anxious. I'm not able to move on for weeks. I get paranoid. Couple days ago, on a wedding, I saw a girl I really liked her but couldn't talk because of some reasons now I'm really paranoid, depressed. I wish I had talked to her even though we will never meet again. What should I do to move on? I keep thinking about her.-I have broken 3 brackets this month 2 of them because I keep on biting to things when I am anxious. I bite my pencil or my pen or my fingers to keep me relaxed amd grounded while the other one was when I accidently hit it with a chicken bone. I am so scared to go to my next appointment because I am scared that she will get mad at me. During the past months, I also broke around 7 brackets (not in the same month) with the same reasons. Will she get mad at me? I feel so sorry for her but I can't help it especially when I am anxious.-Hi, i’ve been really stressed since last night went to a restaurant with my dad and had a really bad experience with two members. I acted like I was calm and fine because my dad was kinda mad and wanted him to be less upset about the situation but omg my anxiety has been so bad. I left a google review and the restaurant accused me of being fake! I feel like they acted like my problems weren’t real and now i’ve just been feeling so sick since yesterday. I can’t sleep or stop thinking about it. I’m so upset ): they were so mean and I just don’t understand why. I can barely function right now I keep thinking about it. Feel so sick and sad bottomless pit in my stomach not coping very well. I hate confrontation and I feel so shit about it. I know im not wrong but now i’m so paranoid I don’t even know what’s going on anymore. Big sad ): Trying to be more assertive but I feel more shit than I did at the beginning): feeling so nauseous want to cryCan someone help me how to cope with this? I already felt very uncomfortable leaving the review but I also feel like they invalidated my feelings and it was so hard for me to even say it in the first place. Feel so horrible. Please help any advice is appreciated.-Just started to take a new pill (escitalopram) and my anxiety gets bad when i eat new stuff or take mew medication scared of allergy or side effects. Would definitely appreciate a hug!-From the conversations I’ve had with people about my anxiety, they often tell me to try and remove whatever is causing it. But I can’t really ever pinpoint one thing, it’s like randomly throughout the day I just feel really anxious and queasy without even having to think about something . Is anyone else the same or do people actually know why they get anxiety and I’m just stupid?-Highly recommend. As a lot of us know we can be anxious about anxiety itself which is a viscious cycle. Just watched an amazing Ted Talk on YouTube called \"How to stop feeling anxious about anxiety\" and the guys perspective is incredible. Sometimes the symptoms of anxiety can be scarier than the initial thing that makes us anxious. Interested to hear what you think.-So I have been getting this weird feeling especially at night when I’m just about to fall asleep it’s like a sinking dizzy feeling then I end up with like butterflies in my tummy, it can also happen when I’m just sitting watching tv too it’s terrifying but my doc seems to think it is anxiety, does anyone else have this kind of thing happen to them-I always try to at least give myself a buffer like, “I’ll try to make it” or “I’ll do my best to be there”. I highly recommend using phrases like this (especially if you’re being genuine!) because it doesn’t tie you to a definite YES but you express that you’re interested and will actually try your best. Before covid, I feel like I went to things 90% of the time. Like why not? I would give myself a time limit and most of the time, my extroverted self would come out. I’d feel tired and depleted afterward but that’s fine.  For context, I live on the fringe of a major city but within an hour on public transportation. This alone is stressful AF to deal with - before and after covid. But I’d do it in most cases.Lately, I’m not sure if it’s increased social anxiety due to not seeing my friends in person for so long or if I’m just more hyper aware of the lengths it takes me to get to places, but I’ve turned into a flanker. Or at least that’s what my brain is telling me I am. Sometimes you have to commit to things and set a time/place. Lately, I’ll cancel before it even gets there or cancel the morning of and give an excuse. Does anyone else do this? Part of it for me is that I also just don’t want to travel an hour in a city riddled with covid cases but it seems like I’m always expected to. Maybe I need to start planning things near me and asking anyone who wants to see me needs to put my comfort first, and not the convenience of meeting right near their house/in their neighborhood.-Hey guys,I'm 32, healthy and relatively in shape. I just ran a battery of exams and my heart is fine according to the cardiologist, but he wasn't much of a talker and as such I couldn't talk much about my problems.&#x200B;Quick weird question, does it happen to you guys when you exert yourself really hard and your heart rate goes up (as it should) that sometimes you get a heart jump (ectopic beat maybe or something similar in feeling) when you deep breathe? I get them only when I deep breathe and I only have one at the time I deep breathe. &#x200B;Either when running fast (mostly after while recovering) or cycling fast (mostly at recovery) I get that feeling, even sniffling hard (because of running in cold weather) gives me one sometimes...  I'm an anxious person, diagnosed with GAD and lately my heart has been too much the center of my attention, I won't deny it... And this might have come from some building up in my head for sure.Doctor didn't even care about it, so I assume it's not bad, but still I'm curious to know if I'm the only one feeling this.Thanks for your timeBest-Hey everyone! First time poster on this subreddit :) I've been running as a way of dealing with my anxiety, and it has been such a gift to me. I feel like I can actually think and be in my body when I'm on a run in a way I can't in \"real life\". I've been dealing with anxiety for as long as I can remember and I'm so thankful that people recommended this to me. Along with this, keto, and other tools that have helped me stay accountable, I feel like I'm such a great spot in my life. Some days are better than others, but it's good to have a community such as this to turn to.Does anyone else use running as a means of anxiety relief? And what else do you do to help? I'd love to bounce ideas off of you.-I was expressing how I’m not even scared of what my anxiety says I should be scared about, I’m just scared of anxiety itself. I have anxiety about having anxiety. And she told me, “most people only find out they have anxiety because they end up in a hospital thinking they’re dying… it’s completely normal to be afraid of a feeling like that.” It blew my mind. I always viewed anxiety as being stupid. Like I felt stupid for being afraid of something so simple like walking into a grocery store, but really, it’s not stupid. It’s a terrible disease. You’re valid in your fears. I love y’all, stay strong in your battles ♥️-Me: (Socially awkward, weak social skills, bad communication skills, verbally inarticulate)A recipe for social disaster.It's unavoidable living in a dorm because many spaces are shared and bathrooms are communal by gender.During Week 0, everyone would greet each other and get to know one another. I managed to meet a few people but it got all too much and I shut down. Meaning.. I avoided making eye contact in fear and dread of potential small talk questions. You know, the nice pleasantries that help start friendships. Even when we start talking, I don't know what to say or ask. Super awkward. I fear I come across as disinterested and rude.Now I feel everyone hates me.It has gotten so bad that I can hear people call me negative curse words under their breath or aloud at me.Whenever people walk past me or interact with me, I hear them call me a b**** or w**** or h**. Idk if it is real or imagined. So after any time in public (going to dining halls, eating, walking to class), it's incredibly stressful. I've already cried so many times too, embarrassing to admit.Some people even lowered their masks temporarily to mutter an obscenity at me, then quickly raise it. Idk who they are, even.The worker who swipes us in at the dining hall also called me an obscenity. I wanted to make sure so I asked \"Sorry?\" but she gave me a straight stare with a knowing smile as if she said what she said and meant it.I understand not everyone will like me. Same vice versa. And that everyones busy with their own lives and dont give two cents about me. but i cant help feeling like theyre talking about me or abhor every single atom that makes up me.But I feel like an outcast and everyone just hates me. I haven't done anything, at least not that I am aware. But I keep hearing people reply to me with profanities.I also feel constantly judged and scrutinized For example: lets say myself or the other person on my floor or strangrr will hold the door open for me/them/him/her, If i say thank you, the other person replies yes or no problem the says the b or h word at me. Is this imagined?If its not imagined then i must be doing something wrong or did something wrong. cause if an entire floor of peers all think im a b or h, then.. the problem probably is with me right?Idk what to do. Some strands of hair turned white on my head from stress lol...  I get teary all the time. And classes only just started..!!! I want to focus on classes but this is so difficult for me. do you have any tips or insights on this?i kinda wonder if its sensory overload from there being so many people around all the time. country girl inna city kind of thing. but it just.. their voices are so real. i think they are real T-T-8am and I’ve been awake the whole night. The last 3 hours I’ve been trying to sleep. But I can’t. One of my nose is blocked and my throat feels like I burped too much and it have a lot of saliva. Just feels uncomfortable. It’s like I can’t breath.  Many times I almost fell asleep but I would wake up to me gasping for air.  I just would like some encouraging words because my whole family is sleeping  (Sunday morning)😫-Does anyone else get super anxious that they accidentally flirt with someone who isn’t your significant other or something like that? Every time I go to a party the next morning I’m paralyzed with anxiety that I did something wrong and my mind obsesses over it :(-I went to my asthma review today and iv been on prozac and have come off abruptly due to suicidal thoughts anyways the withdrawl effects started a few days ago and have peaked yesterday and today so now I cry some of the day especially in the morning I went at 11 and these thoughts come into my mind and although I dismiss them and know they'll go soon I just randomly over nothing just started crying and it just makes me feel so angry at myself as she didn't know what was happening and I just felt so bad she asked for a doctor and I didn't want the help cause I know what is happening I just said to her iv got GAD which I do have that is why I went on them sorry if that offended people in any way and I said I'm fine-Yesterday i took 500 mg , flushed for like 2 hours then started feeling  calm. i am on 10 mg  Lexapro which is not really effective with my anxiety . I woke up today and i feel great . Give it a shot guys-Raise your hand if you've had an anxiety attack at work! Now I'm worried they will fire me or convince me to quit like my last job \"coz I can't handle the stress\". Since I'm a casual they don't need to give me a reason or a warning. Fml.-I lost a great job at the beginning of the pandemic in March of 2020.  I was heart broken.  After 6 months of unemployment,  I landed the nightmare job I currently have.  I remember sitting in my car during lunch the first few days of this job and talking myself out of just leaving.   It was really bad.  The only reason I stayed was to take care of my kids.  It never got better, I worked opposite shift of my wife and kids, and the company was tough to work for.  I have had a lot of jobs, but this one takes the cake for worst job ever.  I was treated like garbage.  Despite this, I stayed for a year.  I survived 2 rounds of layoffs,  got promoted twice, then demoted.  I was targeted,  belittled,  and beaten down by my boss.  I'm writing my resignation letter today!!!!  After a year of job searching,  I finally accepted an offer!.  It's far from my dream job, but it's a step in the right direction!  When I finish working out my notice period, I am going to feel so free!  I already feel better knowing that there is an end in site!-I can feel my anxiety symptoms flaring up recently. Headaches, restlessness, boredom, fatigue, insomnia, and  shallow breathing at times. Just an overall feeling of mush. Can anyone relate? How do you battle seasonal depression?-And why do we have that feeling? The feeling like there was something heavy? Will the feeling decrease in frequency if I will try to stop ruminate? I do not know what fuels the feeling.-After church today I make the drive back home and get ready to start my work week, but this time with a twist.  I have to start planning a move for the month of November.  I'm really anxious about this move because I have many choices to make, and right now my brain seems to be trending towards the ones that will change my life in major ways.  My mind just goes into instant panic mode whenever I consider these options and it makes my decision making ability seemingly vanish.While I spend probably the next few weeks agonizing over all of this unfortunately, I would really appreciate some advice and/or support.-This weekend I was out with family and friends when all of a sudden I started to feel quite dizzy. So I took myself outside to get some fresh air and have a moment to myself.Unfortunately a few people followed me, with best intentions they tried to make sure I was okay. I obviously appreciate it but it just made me feel a whole lot worse. As in my mind, I felt some pressure to \"shake it off\" and I knew I just couldn't and I imagined myself getting worse and worse, even creating a \"scene\". Once I realized I was able to head home from that situation, I naturally started to feel a bit better. But through their comforting at the time, some of them suggested that I may have something like diabetes (!) and to go get tested. Whilst true and something that I should get tested, it's not what I needed to hear at that moment. Being a bit of a hypochondriac, it's plagued me all weekend that I might have to action these tests and I've not felt right since!This morning, I received a message from my boss, just a casual chat about the week, it's fine and normal. But afterwards it instantly triggered another dizzy episode, the room was spinning. But despite all that I've mentioned, I'm quite good at rationalizing with myself. Because I could quite clearly see the trigger, I could quickly dissipate the dizziness.I suppose the pressure to \"feel better\" to be able to make it to work, triggered the dizzy spell? The pressure to \"feel better\" during the first episode, made me worse. The pressure to look after my family (I am my wife's carer and we have a young child), is just always there, I don't really get a chance to rest. I mean, that not true, I get lots of free time. But it seems I have these dizzy spells at the worst time, such as both my wife and child need assistance at the same time! I don't want to let them down but sometimes I just need to sit down and gather myself, sometimes I can't and it makes me feel worse. Sorry, I'm new here, apologies if it's bad etiquette. I just needed to get this written down.Hopefully someone can relate and let me know how they handle, especially feeling dizzy symptoms?-Ok so. I've been good lately in terms of anxiety and even my family have noticed a difference. Been to therapy etc. So today this random guy I don't know texts me a gif of a guy waving. I knew he was just gonna mess around with me like one of those internet trolls, and he did. But then he replied to my questioning of who he was with \"The guy in the van. Want some candy?\". Yeah I know, I know, getting scared of that crap is childish. But I was legit terrified and immediately blocked them. Noe im sitting here almost shaking and I don't know what to do.-If you suffer from any kind of anxiety, you're probably all too familiar with the \"fear of the fear\". You know how anxiety and panic are the worst feelings in the world. It's very hard to put into words how helpless it makes you feel whenever you're in the middle of a panic attack, worried it might never end. I suffered from anxiety and panic disorder for more than 4 years myself.Exactly *because* it feels so fucking horrific, it shouldn't come as a surprise that for nearly all sufferers, *eliminating their anxiety* is their biggest wish. It definitely was for me. It is, however, this fixation on eliminating anxiety, that paradoxically keeps reinforcing your anxiety. It's like a feedback loop from hell.I'm not a scientist, but I've definitely done my fair share of research. Anxiety is regulated in the amygdala. It's supposed to protect you from enemies, animals, dangerous situations, etc. Your amygdala, however, doesn't really function based on rational or logic. It functions based on actions, reactions and behavioral feedback. If a certain event causes you a great deal of stress or pain, your amygdala \"learns\" that that is a danger. It will then try to prevent you from said danger by sending you signals (feelings of anxiety) whenever your amygdala recognizes a potential trigger.So how does this correspond to my claim that the recovery of anxiety is a paradox? Well, let me try to explain: Panic attacks and very strong feelings of anxiety can be absolutely debilitating. You reacted to this by fighting these feelings, trying to avoid triggers, etc etc etc. This has TAUGHT your amygdala that the feeling of anxiety in itself is something dangerous that needs to be avoided! This is a terrible thing because it makes us scared of the anxiety itself. It can turn a slight feeling of anxiety into a full-blown panic attack! Your amygdala will recognize a potential trigger, for example, a bodily sensation that you feel during anxiety or panic, and it will send you more signals to try to warn you of the anxiety! (*Oh no, I'm feeling anxious! I can feel my heart beating fast again! I can feel my stomach feeling weird.. Oh no, I'm going to have a panic attack again! I'm back to square one! All my progress has gone down the drain!)*This can make recovery from anxiety nearly impossible. Fixating on getting rid of the anxiety is a behavior that reinforces the belief of your amygdala that anxiety is bad. It will also keep your amygdala firing signals any time you might feel a little anxious. Recovery from anxiety is **not** possible as long as we are ***anxious*** *of anxiety.*So, how do we turn this around? Its quite easy actually. Its called doing nothing. Like I said before, the amygdala functions based on actions, reactions and **behavioral feedback.** This works the other way around too. We can literally *unlearn* our brain to respond to specific triggers, and even make it less sensitive in general. We do this by practicing acceptance. Acceptence is, in my opinion, the only true cure to anxiety. What I mean by acceptance is not fighting the anxiety. Not fighting the feelings. Not trying to get rid of whatever you're feeling in the moment, not trying to avoid, not trying to escape, not trying to distract yourself. Instead, accept. Sit with it. Float through it. Not reacting to signals from your amygdala is a beautiful thing. It teaches your brain that there is no danger! We need to teach our brain not to fear the feeling of anxiety, for that is a completely natural feeling! We need anxiety! Okay, you're right, we don't need it as much as you are feeling it right now! But still, the feeling of anxiety is not something we need to fear in itself.This is not something that will fix you in an hour or a day. But keep practicing it. Keep sitting with the feelings of anxiety, and you will feel them subside. Don't try to convince yourself you will be okay, for that is ALSO a reaction to amygdala, and like I said before, feedback and reactions will only reestablish that it is a genuine danger, and that your brain is right in sending you these signals! Float through the anxiety. Instead of seeing those moments of anxiety and panic as obstacles, start to see them as opportunities to train yourself! Try to place your worst enemy in a positive perspective, and you will see how fast your perception changes. Everytime you get a panic attack, that’s an opportunity to teach your brain to be less anxious! Those moments of pain are the only moments where true change happens. It is definitely one of the hardest things you can do. Sadly, the only way past anxiety is to go right THROUGH it. You need to completely submerge yourself in it, and, the hardest part, not fight it. You need to look for the anxiety, even invite it from time to time. Make it your friend.The good news is, that going through this will eventually give you a mental toughness that very few people will ever have. You will be so much stronger than anyone else you know. It just takes a lot of courage to start the progress, but I’m sure you can do it .I hope I explained it properly, but English is not my first language so yea. If you have any questions or if you feel like you want me to expand on something please just ask! :)-Does anyone else have this problem where they get anxiety about losing their love or their interest/passion for something? Like for example you go somewhere, and when you come back you just have this unending feeling of dread about whether you’ll lose your interest in something? I went on a boat ride with some family members of mine yesterday for my brother’s birthday and when I got back home I had this feeling, thinking that I would lose my interest in the things that I love. It’s weird and ultimately irrational, but I need to know if I’m the only one. And how I can help mitigate this problem.-Please, I’ve been having constant 24/7 anxiety and shaking and sweating for the past 4 months. Idk what to do. This is unbearable. I got into a motorcycle accident 3 almost 4 years ago. Was taking opioids for awhile. I stopped opioids 4 almost 5 months ago and since then I’ve had constant shaking and anxiety. To a point where I just want to end everything. Please help. I went to a doctor 3 weeks ago who prescribed me busiporne (anxiety meds) which haven’t helped. Please. I’m desperate. The only thing that helps is drinking alcohol but I don’t want to fall into this.-I need someone or *many* someones to feel me, here.  I was talking on a live stream about how bad my anxiety has been all of my life.  That I has left me bedridden and depressed and jobless.  I have gone to therapy and tried conventional medicine for decades, TMS, Ketamine, CES, LENS, CBT, DBT, ERT, mindfulness practices, journaling, meditation, dunking my head in ice water (yes that’s a thing), mantras, manifestations, exercise, no sugar, no caffeine, no alcohol, no gluten, breathing techniques, more sleep, less sleep, can’t sleep.  And you have the NERVE (based on blissful ignorance, I know) to tell me that it’s all in my HEAD!???PS.  It kind of is in my head.  But it’s in my gut, too. You know, the gut brain connection?  I just started working with a functional doctor who is helping treat me based on my genetic variations that cause me to hold onto stress hormones longer than the average gal.  It’s proof, and validation.  I think better days are coming.  They have to.  I’ll let you know what works for me.Anxiety is REAL.And I’m sorry you have it, too.-I have been self-diagnosed with anxiety for about 2 years now, but i only realized that i have anxiety, like, a year ago. I'm 100% sure i have anxiety. As soon as i step out of my house i become self conscious, i start shaking, i walk weirdly, my heart starts pounding heavily, etc... My parents realized yesterday that i was shaking while we were at the mall. Today, my mom started talking about it with me and she told me that I'm probably gonna go to therapy soon. I don't really mind that because it's for the best, but the problem is, i know the biggest reason for my anxiety and nobody else does... And that is, i was being bullied in middle school (I'm in highschool rn). This is the biggest reason why i haven't told my parents about my anxiety before, because i never told them i was being bullied. The reason i didn't tell them is because i feared that they would judge me, and yell at me for not doing anything to stand up for myself, in fact my self-confidence was so bad that i was hanging out with my bullies. I realized later that i made a big mistake because i haven't told my parents since day one that i was being bullied and if i told them now they would be much more mad at me. While my mom and i were talking today, she asked me if i was bullied in school and i lied... I can't even tell my brother the truth, and he is the the only person i don't feel anxious around.I fear that when i start going to therapy, my therapist would most likely ask what's the reason for my anxiety, and i really don't wanna lie, but if i say it's because of bullying he will most likely tell my parents, and i can't even imagine how mad they would be at me for not telling them before. I don't know what to do. I can say that i was always shy and that my self-confidence was always bad (which i also true) but now it turned into anxiety, or i can say the truth and endure my parents yelling at me. I know what's the right thing to do but i don't think i have enough confidence to tell the truth.-Hi! So around may (when i hit rock bottom) my anxiety was extremely bad. Like so bad I was terrified to leave my room. I had stopped going to school, was over eating constantly and was also depressed. In early june my mother had decided to admit me into inpatient, but I ended up going to outpatient lol. (3 times a week for three hours each appointment.) So I did that and worked very very hard. I switched my meds over the summer and started going on walks outside. Today (September 25th) I have now been able to go back to school, go to a restaurant (been twice!) drive myself to the library and also drive to therapy by myself. I’ve been doing so well I have actually, since Thursday, graduated from outpatient and am now seeing a regulars therapist once a week. My conclusion is, it does get better! I’m only 16, but through hard work and determination I was able to start pulling my life together, and you can too. It’s not always easy, but it’s worth it.-I’ve been dealing with anxiety all my life. I had to learn how to train myself on going through with the discomfort and pain anxiety caused me in order to be able to do things normal people do: going to school, going to university, taking exams, driving, meeting new people, anything new really. I learned, for a while, that feeling sick in relation to something new I was about to do, was “normal” for me, but something I had to overcome if I wanted to achieve something in life. I managed to move to another country, find a job, and making friends all on my own. For a while it seemed like I was getting really good at this “living a normal life” thing. Until the pandemic hit. It started with me being terrified of losing my job, then my sister instead lost her job (she lives in the same country as me) and so I was worrying about her. Then worrying about my parents getting sick, and my sisters getting sick. It got to a point where, when nothing was wrong with me and I shouldn’t had to worry about anything, I worried about other people, losing sleep even. And if I don’t worry about other people, then I start worrying about literally anything, even things I know makes no sense, like one night I couldn’t sleep because I was thinking that I didn’t want to die and be reincarnated in someone that lived in a super poor, war stricken country. How absurd is that?? And now anxiety has recently stopped me from accepting a job offer for a job in my field, that I’ve been pursuing for almost a year. The idea of changing job (even tho I wanted to!), starting from scratch and doing something new, the idea of being an impostor and being super under qualified, made me feel so sick that I couldn’t eat and sleep for 2 days. In the end,just to make the feeling stop, I chose to turn down the offer.And now I’m beating myself over it because “what if I never get another opportunity “? I don’t know, I’m just tired of feeling like this and having people judging me because they think I’m lazy, when in reality I would love to do so many things but it’s just so painful!-Hi Please help me I ask for your advice.I would like to know how it is possible that beer makes me feel very good. I am diagnosed with ADHD.My ADHD has never been a problem but since. for the last 4 years I have been experiencing increased fatigue and anxiety and a problem with sleep. I noticed that my anxiety and fatigue disappear after drinking beer. I thought it was only a short-term relief caused by alcohol, but I began to notice that anxiety did not disappear when start drinking beer or getting drunk, but only when I sobering up.I thought it was caused by alcohol, but when I drank other alcoholic beverages, the anxiety is still the same.I experimented and found that after drinking 3.4 glasses of beer I feel fresh and without anxiety (When I drink a lot of beer the next day I feel without anxiety but with a hangover and sadness - I think bcs worse quality of sleep). Falling asleep has improved and the next day I am cheerful and without anxiety. Unfortunately, it doesn't last forever. 2-3 days after (drunk beer) I start to feel anxiety and sadness.I experimented with GABA receptors - (I got some benzo for the test, which helped me (about 2-3 days) with short-term anxiety, but due to addiction, tolerance and unhealthy I quit them) I did not feel as resh and cheerfu after benzo as after beer.I found out that beer contains Uridine (Yes, I know it can be harmful) Uridine helped me fall asleep, but the next day I'm still tired and anxious.I think beer contains some types of probiotics / prebiotics that can improve my anxiety. What do you think about it ?I have already tried a lot of stimulants (Caffeine, Meth, Moda) They only helped for a short time. 1-2 weeks of use, the feeling of fatigue, anxiety and sadness returned. Poor falling asleep, emotional flatness and no-motination.What in beer can so well affect my anxiety motivation and joy?I know that occasional drinking doesn't hurt, but I don't want to drink every 2nd day to feel better. Alcohol does not bring me any greater joy. I like to get drunk with friends 1 month, but I don't want to drink 1 in 2 days so oftenPS: Sorry for my English-And when I say bitch I mean it in the sense that bitch is the most universal word in the English language. For most of my life I felt like I was Medusa. I wasn't a snake-woman hybrid, but my thoughts often felt like a mess of tangled snakes swirling around my brain with violent intentions. At some point, I was talking to a shaman, yes a literal shaman, and I was describing my anxiety to him, and he asked a series of questions. Do you blame your eyes for the things they see?Do you blame your ears for everything they hear?No? Then why do you hold your mind to such high standards? We can't control all the thoughts we have, but we do have the ability to choose how to respond to them. There are a lot of pieces of advice that have helped me over the years, but this one was a special kind of breakthrough. You're thoughts are not always your own, but your reactions always are. We are powerless when it comes to controlling every thought that crosses our minds. Our power comes from choosing how to respond or not respond to these thoughts. Strive for improvement not perfection. One day at a time we march towards a better version of ourselves.-I realize this is probably targeting a very specific group of people on this sub but I wanted to see if their is anyone else that goes through similar experiences as I do as a manager. Ironically a large majority of the staff really likes and respects me due to how calmly I can handle most insanely hectic situations but more often then not I find myself over analyzing just how badly I handled a situation and start to beat myself up over the premise of how I possibly could’ve done a better job, despite inner me knowing I did the best I possibly could’ve. I start to over think interactions I had with others and it’s just a new layer of stress knowing that at the end of the night I am responsible over how smoothly or bad a shift went for the whole crew and the individuals themselves Can anyone else relate to this ?-can't sleep. make it stop-As stated in the title, I forgot to bring my meds during travel. The last time I took them was Thursday and shit has been difficult to say the least. I can't walk for longer than five minutes without the dizziness just completely throwing me off and I'm just irritable 24/7. I keep pushing away my fiancé and all my fears and insecurities are eating away at me. It's really hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel, which is sometime in the middle of next week. Yesterday I didn't eat and I haven't brushed my teeth since yesterday either, because such a mundane task just feels like an insurmountable ask. If any of you have dealt with a task like this, how did you cope for the time being? It's hard to think positive-\\[post cleared\\]-16 year old boy here. A few weeks ago this girl made it clear that she’s interested in me and gave me her number. She’s pretty cute and is fun to be around so I could really see myself growing to like her a lot. But one huge problem I have is that I never know how to start good convos. I always overthink what I’m going to say and become too anxious to even attempt to start one so I almost never end up talking to her, but she still makes it clear that she has interest in me. I’m really worried that I’ll brood over what to say for too long and she’ll end up losing interest in me. How can I overcome this?-Around 6 years ago I posted a screenshot of my playlist on my Snapchat story. The picture was captioned \"girly hipster music yay\". There was some AC/DC in there. One guy screenshotted my picture and messaged laughing at me that AC/DC isn't girly. I stupidly got defensive because he came out of left field and we weren't that close. I happened to look at his GFs twitter and she posted the screenshot there as well to laugh at me. I still think about this, any tips on getting over dumb situations?-TW: suicidal thoughtsShould I be concerned? I've been having a lot of thoughts along the lines of \"I want to die.\" or \"I hate living.\" or \"I hate myself.\" I don't think I completely mean it, because I don't really want to kill myself. I just kind of wish I could stop existing or having to deal with life. I'm not sure if it's my anxiety or depression, but I don't really feel in control of my life, and I come to some sort of realization that I don't think I'm ever going to enjoy life. It just feels empty and meaningless and too difficult to keep dealing with.-I am a senior in high school and I have become more anxious and depressed the closer I’ve gotten to my eventual graduation. I care way too much about how people perceive me so I panic during every conversation and that just makes me more awkward which I panic over again. No matter what happens in a social interaction I walk away hating myself that much more. I don’t know what will happen to me once I have to start the rest of my life. I have no motivation to do anything in my life because of this because I have no hope for my future. I have a small group of friends but that’s only because I became friends with them in middle school while my anxiety was manageable. I haven’t had a legitimate conversation with a girl that is more than general schoolwork questions since probably 6th grade. I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to date because even if I get a girlfriend I will just panic over every possible thing in my relationship. I’ve had a job before and I technically still have it and should be going back to it but I haven’t because the thought of talking to my bosses and coworkers again stresses me out so much I just don’t want to do anything. This is why I panic over my future because I can’t live like this. Looking back at what I wrote it seems so silly but in my brain it’s monumental and I don’t know I’m sorry for the big paragraph I’ve never put these thoughts into words before.-Hello. I’m a 30F, and I’ve had some mild anxiety (mostly health anxiety) throughout my life that was mostly manageable. I did have some pretty rough periods about 10 years ago, but not really comparable to what I’ve been going through lately.Basically, I’m in a psych ward rn because after a bad reaction to antibiotics, I ended up with nightly nocturnal panic attacks that left me very sleep deprived and extremely sick over 18 nights in a row.Since being here, they’ve been giving me a little lorazepam (Ativan), which helped initially (it’s been 2.5 weeks now) but I’m still having break-through anxiety (current dose is 0.25mg in the morning and 0.5mg approx 6:30pm) and sleep is getting challenging again. I’m also PMSIng now so that might be making things worse.I’m getting concerned because I keep losing my appetite and eating becomes incredibly hard, constant nausea or just feeling overwhelmed when I try to eat. I’m losing weight kinda fast and I wasn’t that big to begin with. I’ve been awake now since 5:30am trembling a little and trying to fully accept the anxious sensations without judgement but I also feel so hungry and don’t know what to do. :( I’m trying to be strong but this is getting so exhausting. 8 weeks ago I loved sleeping and loved eating, and it’s still difficult for me to comprehend how I’ve deteriorated so rapidly. So far my doctor has been reluctant to start me on an SSRI but I’m feeling pretty desperate for help rn. Someone who’s been through something similar and got to the other side, please guide me 😢-But when my anxiety gets triggered i suddenly shut down completely.-In the past three months I have:- switched directly from Paxil to Lexapro (went badly)- went back to Paxil and added Abilify (tried it for two weeks and hated it)- went back to just Paxil and added 1 mg of Ativan daily (though you’re not supposed to take it daily)- tried testosterone injections (my testosterone is off-the-charts low for a 49yo)- cross-tapered from Paxil to Lexapro (3 weeks now)- added Ambien for sleep - stopped the testosterone because I felt like it was too many variablesSo now I’m down to 10 mg Lexapro (3 weeks in), Ambien and 1 mg of Ativan. I’ve been feeling major physical anxiety, mood swings and zero motivation.  I think a lot of this has to do with still ramping up on the Lexapro and likely being “hooked” on the Ativan and getting “rebound anxiety”. It’s probably also not smart to be on Ambien too. So, I think I am going to try to taper off the Ativan and Ambien. I’m worried it will be really hard because I’m in a very stressful part of my job but I think I need to do this. Wish me luck and feel free to send advice.-I think I'm having an anxiety attack. I drank a cup of coffee for the first time in a month. Now my thoughts are racing and they don't feel right. Each thought that pops in gives me a rush of anxiety and I don't feel in control of them, they feel unreal.I don't feel able to get off the bed, I feel like I'm going tk die any second, my heart isn't racing and I'm not breathing fast I just feel like I'm going to die.Someone please help I'm all alone.-So I've started this new job working from home as a call center agent, and so far so good. All my reasonable fears have been proven false: I had ample training, language isn't as big a barrier as antecipated and the amount of calls is manageable. Still, I'm a nervous wreck. Dry heaves, heart bursting from my chest, feeling like crying all the time. It's not my first job by any means, and the other ones were more demanding/ stressful, but I can't remember it ever being so bad. Can someone help me process this?-I’m really passionate about reading and writing and I’m considering becoming a teacher but I’m not sure if this career is right for me because of my social anxiety. I actually visited my high school to talk with one of my English teachers about what it’s like being a teacher and I starting shaking and having trouble breathing as soon as I saw all of those high schoolers walking past me in the hallway even though it hasn’t been long since I’ve graduatedI was originally thinking of teaching high school or middle school but based on the anxiety I felt I’m not sure I’m cut out for teaching in general, I don’t feel this type of anxiety when I’m walking around college and even around my classmates, I just feel like the high school crowd can be super harsh and judgemental and maybe that’s why I felt so much anxiety?The thought of parent teacher conferences and interacting with parents in general also gives me anxiety, I used to work in a dental office and some parents were really judgemental/entitled (not saying all parents are like this, most were really nice but there were some that were really rude)Are there any good and well-paying careers out there for people with social anxiety? I’m thinking of going for medical assisting or nursing but I’m honestly not sure at this point-Hey guys! I have this problem with responding to texts and missed calls. I proceastinate it like crazy. I won’t respond for weeks ... It happens when I feel depressed. I recluse myself socially. But the pandemic made it really bad. Do you have any advice? I don’t want be such a rude person but I feel like I freeze up when I‘m trying to respond to a text....-(This is also a bit of a vent, but I think it helps paint the picture of my problems)Backstory as to why I have this problem in the first place. When I was 15 I got my first girlfriend (which compared to my friends, I was pretty late in the game). The whole thing lasted two months. The reason we broke up? She was using me to get closer to one of my friends. Now, I understand that 15 is pretty young, and some might even role their eyes at the fact of “this 15 year old got his heart broken boo hoo”. I get that, but that’s bullshit, cuz that fucking HURT. It really fucked with my mind, started making me wonder “Does this mean I’m not good enough?” “Do people just not want to date me?” “Jesus Christ, what’s wrong with me?”, Shit like that. Also I’ve been hinted at several times that I’m ugly. Or at the very least not the most good looking person in the bunch. So that’s also fucked with me mentally. Anyways, fast forward. I’m in college, and I haven’t dated since I was 15. There are a ton of beautiful looking women all around. And the only problem is I can’t build up the courage to talk to them. Every time I see a girl I’d at least like to try and start a conversation with, I just can’t bring myself to do it. Also I feel I should mention I’ve never had a girl once try something like that with me. I’ve seen it happen to my friend/dormmate several time throughout the years. And it’s already happened a couple of times since college started, so I know I’m not crazy thinking that a girl not even giving me the time of day isn’t normal. So what should I do? How do I talk to women?- Alright guys, I was taking 7.5mg of Vortioxetine (trintellix) and one  month in I started getting those difficulty falling asleep. Whenever I  fall asleep my body wants to go full hypnagogic and do an \"astral  travel\" I am not really into esoteric, but lets call it Astral Travel. I  get the mini brain zaps, cold shivering, my body feels lighter and  colder. I then get the vibration feeling like I am vibrating completely.  If I try to let it, I just shake and convulse. I have to try and try  and try to fall asleep. At first I was so scared that I couldn't sleep  and the less I slept the more I thought that I was going insane. I  finally had an appointment with my GP and he prescribed seroquel and  said we would taper off Vortioxetine, however now seroquel makes my  whole body shake like crazy and this gives me even more anxiety. We  don't know if I am bipolar, we don't know if the anxiety etc is caused  by my Hormone replacement. We just don't know and I am a guinea pig. I  feel hopeless. I just want to go back to my older self before I tried  smoking weed (everything started after smoking weed). I have a family  history of bipolar and schizophrenia and knowing that makes me even more  anxious. Anyone has ever experienced that?-Today, for example, I'm running a 3 hour D&D session for some friends here in a few hours. That's it--I have absolutely no other plans for the day. Despite that, I have this constant feeling of anxiety and dread hanging over me. I feel like I can't start something (say, get into a game or practice drawing) because I have this **thing** coming up. It doesn't matter how much I like doing the thing, or how I know it's going to be a good time.This extends to pretty much anything that I schedule. I've tried timeblocking strategies before to add some structure to my free time (ie Drawing practice from 1pm-3pm, then gaming/chill time from 3-5pm, dinner, etc etc). Nope, instant anxiety and dread as long as there's still something 'scheduled' for later that day.If you're also someone who deals with this, how do you work to mitigate it? I can't go through life just constantly feeling like garbage whenever I have something planned, hah. Feeling like this kills my productivity, too, because I just can't get myself to focus on other stuff in the meantime.-hi guys! is anyone here on buspirone and do you drink while using it? I'm not a heavy drinker, but my psychiatrist is sort of weird about alcohol and drug use. by this i mean that if you ask for guidance about alcohol while on a med you mostly get \"i don't approve of getting drunk\". she is sort of my only option right now bc the psychiatry is free through my university. anyway, I've been sticking really heavily to the one drink rule. has anyone's doctor advised them differently? I'm just scared I'll get drunk one night and not wake up or something. that's probably a little irrational, but hey-- that's why I'm on anxiety meds. tl;dr how much do you drink on buspirone? has anyone's doctor given them good guidance?-Im a young male, often checking for apt, have no health problems and i still get palpitations, tachycardia, sweating, high blood pressure, dizziness, headaches often, everyday. Atm im on a benzo and ssri medicamentation that is helping me alot but still cant get rid off these things which are really annoying. Anyone here feel the same and got any solutions ? Will these symptoms go away by the time ? Thanks!-I (22F) have been dating my boyfriend, 22M for about a year. I’ve told him before I used to have an anxiety disorder (social anxiety disorder) but have never really gone into true depth about how much that affected me and the leftover effects of it. For context, I had SAD as a child and a teenager. It was socially and mentally crippling for me. Constantly thinking people were judging me, struggling with my self esteem, bad physical anxiety. Etc etc. I didn’t get any help for it until I was 18/19. I went to a therapist and got CBT and it changed my life. I don’t qualify as fitting the DSM-5 diagnosis for SAD anymore because of therapy and working on myself. However, I still consider myself to be an anxious person. I still struggle with anxiety. And I still have to work on my self esteem. Years and years of formative experiences and emotions being wrecked by anxiety can do that to a person. My boyfriend and I never fight; we just get along well enough not to. The one thing he gets upset at me about is that he feels that I don’t make decisions enough in our relationship. It started out that he didn’t like that he had to choose the restaurants we would go to. So I started trying to choose the restaurants. I’m definitely doing better on that front. Then it developed into okay, I choose restaurants, but he wants me to choose activities to do as well. So I’m working on that. He doesn’t like that I don’t play my music in the car and we always listen to his. So now I’m trying to play my music more. He says he talks more than me and starts more conversations and that bothers him. I said, I’m a naturally more quiet person. We had a conversation about that. We had a conversation about how if me not making a specific decision bothers him/frustrates him, he needs to communicate with me and tell me instead of just acting mad at me and causing me to anxiously spiral about why he’s mad. It’s a very emotional and triggering topic for me because growing up, I was always “that quiet girl,” my mom was constantly telling me to be more assertive, and I feel like I’ve been criticized for similar things my whole life. Communicating about it with him made me cry because like I said, it is triggering. But I’m proud of myself for communicating. We talked about how he is going to need to work on having empathy for me in these situations instead of always getting frustrated, and how he needs to communicate more. I need to make more decisions and act without overthinking things. I don’t think my boyfriend is 100% right about everything he said regarding the conversation-he said I don’t come up with conversation topics which just isn’t true. He FEELS that way though, which makes it his truth and so I told him I will work on that. It was also hard for me because I feel like he isn’t very reassuring. In that situation, getting a big hug and him letting me know he cares about me and likes me regardless would have been what I needed. Instead, I was the one telling him how much I care about him. He shows me he cares about me so it’s not that he doesn’t, however, I’ve been trying to work up the courage to tell him I love him and these recent events make me scared to say it first. It is a little frustrating to me because it’s like I know I have things to still work on regarding the above mentioned issues, but it is annoying because I feel like he should be more understanding and less quick to get in a bad mood or upset about it. Any thoughts on going forward and strengthening my relationship?-I've got no outlet for venting or advice, I'm so fucking alone. Just finished high school and everyone I knew moved so far out of state. I have no friends stating at home, my parents don't even slightly understand my condition, and my therapist doesn't want to see me anymore. I'm fucking breaking down I'm cutting again and punching holes through the drywall. Covid making me go to stupid fucking online school so I sit in my room for hours everyday staring at this screen and I can barely make myself leave or eat or socialize or fucking anything. I'm so off putting, got no social skills, and I'm withdrawaling so bad now that I'm trying to stop smoking. I need reasons to not just off myself. I wanna feel normal. I want friends. I want the bad feelings to stop. I'm wasting away. I have nothing left and I want to die-I'm not sure if I'm just being a little whiny but I've never felt this down before. My job is so stressful and I am having a lot of problem with my family. I'm a breadwinner and even though I'm just so sick of my job, I can't quit. It's eating me up. I just don't think I'm doing well in any aspect of my life. I've gained weight because I've noticed that whenever I'm sad I'm gonna grab something to eat to feel better. I'm anxious to go to a doctor because in my country there is a dilemma, mental health awareness isn't really a thing here and I'm scared that what I'm feeling is not valid at all. I tried opening up to someone but unfortunately it was shrugged off. I'm having thoughts of ending it all but since I provide for my siblings and parents, it's just hard. Thank you-Hello I’m kind of new here. I’ve suffered from anxiety when I was a little kid, but recently I’ve been struggling again. I believe it’s due to the steroids I got put on for antipsychotic-induced dysphagia. I have anxiety so severe that I’m afraid to eat. Have any of you ever had anxiety get this bad?-I wasn't sure where to post this. I guess it's a relationships issue, and I do have OCD but I feel like this relates more to my anxiety. Pretty much all my life I've had a cycle of becoming interested in someone romantically, and then my emotional wellbeing depends purely on the response I get from them.My current situation is that I've met someone online (I play online video games and so tend to meet friends that way regularly) but this particular person I've taken a fondness to.We have been playing together pretty much every night for the last 2 months and when we're done we'll spend an hour sometimes more just talking about general stuff. He suggested we swap numbers so we could send eachother pics of stuff we were talking about (food and stuff like that) so we did. We only talk as friends and he rarely ever messages me unless we're talking about a specific thing.Despite the fact that he seems uninterested in me, I still feel so sad and anxious during the day and then get the highest of highs if he does reach out to me. I just feel like I'm never happy just in my own company, doing my own thing. I'm always relying on these people to throw me scraps.I feel so frustrated that I'm like this. Why do I even care about someone who shows no interest in me? I was laying in bed last night and the rational part of my brain was saying 'this person who you've never met shouldn't dictate your happiness like this'. But I just can't stop feeling this way. I feel so silly and embarrassed to be honest. I'm 31.I just needed to write this out because I feel so down.-I started having bad anxiety after a bad panic attack from eating edibles about a year and a half ago and and after many tips to the ER over panic attacks and thinking I’m having a heart attack I just deal with it, but I constantly have heart palpitations especially at night and I’m kinda shaky at times and I’m on anxiety medication.. I was also told I have Nash liver so worrying about that makes my anxiety 10x worse it just seems like I can’t get my mind off of this stuff. Any advice I also have all kinds of physical anxiety symptoms when I’m sure it’s all in my head it’s still rough to handle and get control of. When does it get better?-Well.. I’m embarrassed as can be. Panic attack got bad enough that I called 911. My heart was going faster than ever, I was so dizzy, I couldn’t breathe. By the time the ambulance was about to be here I was fully aware it was just a severe panic attack. I can’t believe I did that, but I felt like I had no other choice. Has anyone else done this for panic/anxiety?-I’m able to track back some of this but not all so I’m not sure where it’s true origin came from yet. I remember developing the skill at least as far back as high school when teachers would ask me 20 questions just so I could go work on something else in my free period. I garnish my reasoning of why I need to leave to make them less likely to say no. I grew up with a not great step dad and a mom who didn’t stick up for me so I would tell not total truths and answer bare minimum questions just to avoid the wrath of being berated/talked down to instead of being offered help. So now it’s turned into whenever a family member asks where I’m going and I’m going to see someone they don’t know or wanna do something without having to hear what they think I just say I’m with someone they know to avoid all the question surrounding who the new person is. Or if I want to go camping with a friend I don’t feel like being told all the reasons why it’s not a good idea. I just don’t like giving anyone 24/7 access to everything I’m doing and I don’t want to get wrapped up in meaningless conversations so I tell small lies even when I don’t need to I still do it because that’s how deep the habit is rooted.-Yea so yesterday I went to the ER at like 3:30 AM and didn’t get home till like 8AM… it was an awful experience. Anyways, today I’m sitting here laying in bed trying to fall asleep and everytime my body drifts off into sleep I get what feels like a jolt of adrenaline that shoots up through my body as if I was jump scared but without the jumping part. Its happened probably 10+ times and It’s really driving me crazy, I’m so tired especially from yesterday, I slept from 8:30AM til like 2 PM so I’m not completely sleep deprived so I don’t know why I can’t just fall asleep. Does anyone know how to stop this? It probably doesn’t help that I didn’t eat anything till right before bed I made some eggs and drank an electrolyte drink.-(tw)my anxiety is just so bad now, i feel so useless i can barely get myself to do anything, i always try to plan productive days but anxiety seriously gets the best of me time and time again, any small inconvenience can send me into a episode of just crazy intense end of the world feelings, to the point where i think how much easier things would be if i weren’t here… i’ve tried so hard to look for help i feel like everyone’s ignoring the signs but i am straight up asking for help… i would never hurt myself but anything is better than feeling like this. as distractions i try so hard to go out as much as i can and i always feels so burnt out and restless… ahhh idk just needed to get this off my chest- I am 20 years old, and up to my time in high school and also last year of work, I never suffered from anxiety (especially physically) in fact I didn't even know what it was practically. Then a lot has happened in the last few months, I broke up, I changed jobs, and especially an accident happened, On August 15th, I unconsciously mix a medicine (for allergy) and after smoking a joint, I start having a bad trip. , which led me to a sort of temporary derealization of about (3-4 days)    From that experience something had changed in me, I felt very often pressure in the chest, blurred vision, dizziness that I did not immediately relate to anxiety but probably to my low blood pressure, but I was wrong.    Now I have started a psychotherapeutic journey, to try to defeat these demons in my head.  I no longer feel myself, the sunny and productive person that I was, has faded a lot.  How could this have happened I ask myself again ... I swear to you that I have never suffered from all this, it exploded like this and I feel that my life is shattering.-Just wanted to complain that's all.-i just went back to this weekend program i do for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic and i’m relatively new to it. i have a handful of friends there but it was all online also year so i didn’t get to meet everyone and figure out how everything works yet. it’s a big group and it’s hard for me to not feel so overwhelmed. i had a pretty good time, like everything seemingly went smoothly, but i can’t let go of the fact that something just didn’t feel right about it. i felt like i always said the wrong thing, or that every time i opened my mouth i was complaining and needed to be reassured and that i was being annoying and pessimistic. or that i wasn’t friendly enough because i was so in my head and anxious and now people think i hate them. for example, i have a friend i really like and we talk all the time but suddenly it was so much harder in a group dynamic and i feel like i wasn’t being as good of a friend to them as i usually try to be. and i couldn’t tell if they wanted to be around me or not and i just felt like i wasn’t being entertaining or compassionate enough or something. so i didn’t even talk to them as much as i really wanted to because i didn’t want to bother them with my presence but i also feel like maybe they feel bad or like i was avoiding them? but i have no idea how to tell the difference with body language. like, i keep forgetting how hard and draining it all is. i literally feel so empty inside now and like such a burden and so undesirable in so many ways. and nothing bad even really happened. i even made new friends and everyone i met likes me (seemingly). but i just can’t shake the feeling that i fucked it all up and that the world would be better off without me around. i literally don’t know why but large group activities make me borderline suicidal afterwards for a few days and i can’t figure out why. i don’t even feel like a person i just feel like a shell that does whatever i can to make sure people like me and still somehow messes it up. i feel like a dumb little alien that is trying to copy how everyone is socializing. i just want it to be easy. i wish i could just be myself. i hate it.-Through out middleschool and highschool, I hated public speaking or having to present because I would get extremely nervous and get common physical symptoms such as rapid heart rate, upset stomach, sweating, etc. It would get so bad, that I would miss school to avoid doing it. If I couldn’t avoid it, I would stutter, turn bright red, and my head would go blank during presentions. Ice breakers/introductions where also anxiety inducing. For a while, I believed I had a mild form of social anxiety but I brushed it off because I dont like the idea of self diagnosing, and just told myself that these are normal feelings everyone goes through. Now im a sophomore in college, these feelings still follow me during social situations. However, I’ve been feeling very anxious for a different reason. Im so stressed out about my grades and so worried about the future, that it prevents me from living in the present. I always arrive to class 30 minutes early, and while I wait for it to start I catch my heart rate increasing and I have a hard time controlling my breathing. During class, I can’t even concentrate because im too busy worrying. When I’m studying, I suddenly have stop because I get small bursts of anxiety. This dread over the future overcomes me, and negative thoughts such as “you’re gonna fail all your classes” and “you’re not gonna be successful” pop up in my head. I’ve been having a hard time focusing and getting assignments done because of this. I know things like these are common in college students, so I’m hesistant to talk about it with my doctor or anyone for help, but I’m tired of having lived in an anxious state the majority of my life.-does anyone else feel like they have to force themselves to eat food/ daily meals when having anxiety ? it feels as if it is the hardest task to do (in the moment it is) without feeling like throwing it up :/-Today I got the covid vaccine and I'm kind of worried about the side effects.-Please someone talk to me-A normal heart rate is between 60 and 100, 60 is low and usually means you either healthy or dying usually healthy. But my heart rate has gotten below 50, and that’s not even taking in account for when I’m asleep. I have the excuse that I was an athlete, I swam for 12 years. But still I don’t think I should be nauseas, dizzy, and sometimes I get chest pain. I’ve gotten 4 ECGs, 2 chest X-rays, blood work, ultrasound of heart and I was cleared except for a sinus arythmia that could’ve been caused by dehydration, stress, or cardiac problems so I never know to be worried or not. Maybe it’s in result of quoting a sport that I was doing all my life or maybe it’s anxiety, or maybe I’m dying who knows?-I’m in my house right now forgot to take buspirone this morning. Had a near panic attack from these loud ass cars in my neighborhood combined with these new neighbors using a chainsaw in the dark. Didn’t even use it just pulled the cord(thought it was gunshots and people screaming everyone’s dogs were barking). All while trying to do math and waiting for my dad to bring over my medicine to my moms house. Everyone’s enjoying the football games in their backyards and I’m in my house having a meltdown/ driving around my neighborhood trying to figure out what’s going on. I feel like I’m being controlled by anxiety and I’m not my true self. I’d do literally anything to get rid of it.-My face flushes randomly when I talk to people even though I’m not feeling nervous. It also happens randomly out of nowhere. I find it flush a lot after playing an intense video game. I’m not feeling stressed or nervous. My flight or fight does not come on. Could it be more than that?-I'm 17 and got my first job at a fast food restaurant. Yesterday was my first day working there and it was extremely chaotic because there was an audit happening. The manager barely helped me and I had to rely on following the other workers. After work I had a panic attack and I already hate working here. I struggle with social anxiety and this job makes it worse. I want to quit but I know my mom and my friends would be disappointed. I'm not sure what I should do.-nan-We had a group math presentation and when it was my turn to explain the math formula I blanked out, my hands became cold and my hands were shaking as well as my legs and bailed by asking my partner to take over. When we got back to the table, This one girl complained how awkward I did and we would get a 60% and told me to “just read the board it’s just numbers” WOW I told her out of frustration “I HAVE ANXIETY!” and wrote a letter to the teacher to take a walk outside as I’m having a anxiety attack and broke down in the hall. A lot of people walked pass without stppping because we live in a selfish world-I’m worried sick to my stomach for my mother who had her appendix ruptured and needs an appendectomy, my anxiety levels already spiked this high back when she was diagnosed with diabetes even though she’s kept it well under control the whole way. I keep googling the procedures which is messing me up hard. and apparently she would like to get her hysterectomy done as-well since she had it planned for a about a week or two from today. But ended up needing to go to the ER for a bad pain she felt in her stomach which she assumed was just gas since around yesterday. Though apparently it wasn’t bad enough to where she’d need an immediate surgery. I understand that nobody online could ever truly relate and I have faith that she will be able to pull through but I can’t stop making it worse for myself. Any tips or possible closure?-I recently found a great group of people through a podcast. We watch movies through discord and make jokes but, I’m so fucking awkward. I feel like I can’t even have a normal conversation with anyone even virtually and I wonder what’s wrong with me? How do I stop thinking so negatively?-For a while now I've had this weird issue and wanted to poke the community for suggestions. When I sleep or dissociate I unconsciously squeeze either my hands leaving nail marks or my legs and I don't even realize I'm doing it until I do and fully relax. I'm currently on Buspirone and it helps for the constant \"static tv\" ambient anxiety but not my weekly panick attacks. Thoughts? Thank you so much in advance!-Just here to complain. My anxiety, depression, and manic bipolar have pushed everyone I love away. I have tried getting a doctor for treatment but I've been unmedicated my entire life. I even stopped going to doctors the day I turned 18. I just got insurance for the first time and the first doctor my insurance assigned me was out of practice. So I had my insurance transfer me to another office. The second one wasn't even accepting new patients and didn't tell us until I was trying to schedule appointments with them.. The third doctor was booked out 8 months. And now the fourth doctor is not returning my voice mails I keep leaving them.. I've left 6 in about 3 months. I have severe and debilitating anxiety attacks every single day. They almost always start with tension in my chest  then my nose starts to close up and my hands begin to feel numb. I get a headache usually in my eyes. I start to feel weird, kind of airy, then I get cold sweats. My heart starts to race and pound. It gets hard to breathe. Then my heart rate drops. Good second or longer in-between heart beats. My hearing goes away and I start feeling super cold and I shiver. I feel like I'm going to die. I'm home alone tonight and I have Covid. No one cares. I can barely breath from Covid and it triggers my anxiety attacks. I've had 3 today and I feel another onsetting. I'm only 27 years old and I hate feeling like I'm going to die. I've had such a hard life and I've never learned how to enjoy basically anything. I just wish things were easier.-Lately my tongue feels huge and my neck feel swollen but then it’ll go away or I won’t notice when I’m distracted. I do have trouble breathing but I always have with my anxiety I hyperventilate or start to manual breathe. I’m like should I go get my throat checked out or is this anxiety. Cause my throat doesn’t hurt it’s not swollen just feels swollen-Started job last monday, 1st week completed. Y'all cannot imagine how overwhelming this situation has become. I miss my parents, the comfort of my home, even though my office is in the same city as my house. I don't like the work. I wait for 6pm to happen so that I can rush and go to home and I can be around my parents. I get very anxious when I'm alone in the office. Feels like just quitting and going to home.In the washroom, My eyes get wet thinking and I mildly cry because I miss my mother and I start getting deep breaths. I am single child of my parents, so the love and affection they've given me is impeccable, and maybe that's why I miss them so much.I realise, I used to have the same thing when I was a little boy in play school and used to cry whole day just to go home. This is, probably the same sort of thing again, the only thing is, I'm in my 20s now. I'll be moving to abroad next year, away from my parents and family, Idk what I'd be doing there without meeting my parents for such a long time. Please somebody help me.-Whenever I mess up with somebody or something I always feel like I always need closure. Recently I was in a situation where I messed up with somebody and I said sorry but they didn’t accept it. The thing is, I know what this person is like. They’re not the type to forgive easily and I didn’t expect them to forgive me but it still hurt for some reason.-I have a gad and frequently have headaches in isolated points on my head (back right and front left usually) and while I know this could be due solely to stress, exhaustion, hunger, etc. etc., I’ve convinced myself it’s because of tumors. Is this a viable concern or just another anxiety symptom?-Hi,I get really tense in my shoulder, neck and back and it gets worse throughout the day. Does anyone recommend any vitamins or cbd oil to relax?-My body is in constant fight or flight mode, I hate it. My boyfriend is starting to feel my anxiety himself and he doesn’t deserve it, why should he reassure me all the time? Anxiety is a real bitch. My father has had 4 strokes within 3 weeks and doctors tell us there’s nothing else they can do now. The first stroke happened and thanks to Covid, there were no beds available in the city who maybe could have helped him more. Just frustrated, angry and sad.A small stray cat showed up at my back door this afternoon who was super friendly and it set off an anxiety attack for no frickin reason, like why? This little cat just wanted to say hello and get a snack. I’m here with you all who need need to vent!-I'm just sick of this already. Ever since I took Lexapro, I think, and it made everything a 100x worse I've just been getting very strong episodes of deja Vu. Anyways had one today went into full panic. Maybe I'm dead and this is just my sad lonely life flashing before my eyes.-Not all the time obviously. I have noticed lately people in general don't take anxiety spending seriously. It has some very dibilitaring long term harm. One bad attack and your life can just be wrecked. So much self harm and people just don't take it seriously. Watching my spending (curse you Amazon!) To monitor my anxiety level has really been effective.-i turned 31 yesterday, and have been dealing with anxiety most of my life. I smoke regularly, and have always managed without anything else. I exercise and work with kids and animals, so I’m usually happy.I suddenly lost my mom in april and have been extremely down and sad. The anxiety mixed with depression, is heavy, so I told my doctor. She put me on Celexa and I am not interested in the slightest.I hated the two days I tried ( I know it takes longer than that, but I had horrible bloody visions everytime i closed my eyes), so I want something else. IS THERE ANYTHING that I don’t have to take everyday that would help? I know xanax is probably hard to come by in 2021, so what’s a helpful alternative?hopefully this is allowed, i am ok and managing…but I really miss sleeping and laughing-I have GAD, and I'm not sure if it's related to this situation. Essentially, I have some sort of problem with the backs and tops of my ears (externally, not the inside of my ears). I've been noticing it since COVID started, when masks would irritate my ears, but I think it's been an issue for a long time. Just wearing my glasses can make me uncomfortable, especially with my hair. I'm constantly taking my glasses off and putting them back on- I don't like to have any hair under the glasses, not even my baby hairs/short hairs underneath that inevitably end up under an arm of my glasses. Obviously, not wearing my glasses isn't really an option, although I do try to give myself frequent breaks throughout the day. I can't really describe how it feels when my glasses are in an uncomfortable position. Overwhelming, uncomfortable, but if I focus on it it's not physically irritating, so I don't think it's some kind of skin issue. It's not even that I feel anxious, I just feel like it's wrong and I need to fix my glasses and hair. It hasn't cause any huge problems, like I haven't had any anxiety/panic attacks about it, but it's a constant annoyance that just keeps getting worse. It's especially bad now because my touching all around the sides of my ears has given me a couple pimples, so it hurts every time I go to adjust. I'm also wondering if it might be a sensory processing issue, but I don't know much about that. I'm not sure if I've explained any of that well. I barely understand it myself. Any advice/insight would be greatly appreciated!-For maybe the last 10 years (35 now) I’m unable to watch sports where I want a certain party to win, unless they are likely to be completely dominant. It started out with not being able watch my favourite football team (soccer) but had now stretched to any sport where a Brit may be participating, whether I have a real love for the sport or not. This has meant missing Emma Radacanus win in the US Open, Lewis Hamilton in the F1, England in the Rugby, and cumulated with Joshua loss to Usyk, where I had to dig ridiculously deep to finish listening to the 12 rounds and now feel so depressed. This can’t be normal? In normal life I’m a highly functional professional, Ans a fair bit in my career, but sports and especially my “team” losing affects me badly!-Iv been having anxiety over This for a month now but every time I drink or eat something it always feels like my body fights me not to swallow it. Whenever I take a drink I’m always concerned about where it’s going same with food. Idk if it’s because I think I’m gonna choke on the food suddenly or because something has happened to me-My anxiety has been very bad for the last 9 days. A change in my living situation puts me living with my primary trigger and unfortunately it's not going to change anytime soon. I've had a number of panic attacks and on Tuesday went to the ER even though I was sure it was just a panic attack because I hadn't been able to calm down in 2 days.I am feeling a bit better now but still experiencing generally high anxiety levels that I can't get down for more than a couple hours. With that I have pain across my chest, my arm, in my shoulder and side and over my lower ribs. It's intermittent and gets worse as the anxiety gets worse. It's probably just the muscles responding to being so tense for so long.The doctors said there was no emergency and this has been my third anxiety related ER trip this year. The first was when I learned I had it. The pain though is feeding the anxiety in a loop and I don't know how to deal with it. It's just constant. My doctor has me on Wellbutrin, it has helped until this recent episode, and the benzo he has me supplement with dosent help with the physical effects I think. It just makes me tired and only sometimes. My friends have been able to distract me enough to help when it's an attack but I can't keep relying on them and I don't know what to do about the day to day. I have been doing the breathing exercises my therapist told me to do. They help some.Is it like this for anyone else? The constant worrisome pain. Always feeling on edge and tense? Is this just my life now? I just want to feel \"fine\" again.-First time posting here. I've had an awful week. The last time I felt this bad was 8 years ago, so it's been extra awful. Because of the stress I'm under, it feels like someone is sitting on my chest or reaching inside, crushing it. It's so uncomfortable and painful. If I didn't know it was from anxiety, I'd probably go to the hospital. I can't take my Ativan until bedtime so during the day, I don't know what to do. I can get over my other daily panic attacks and crippling anxiety but the chest pain is too much. Any suggestions?-I just wanted to reach out and see what helps quell others when they’re anxious. I have severe attacks and it will even trigger hyperventilating. Last night I had one of my worst attacks in a year and all of my tricks weren’t working. I had calm music, I took a lukewarm bath, made tea, tried ice cubes on the insides of my wrists and back of my neck and I just couldn’t calm down. I just wanted to reach out and maybe learn some new techniques for calming down? Help? 🥺-so i was working an airshow for my Navy cadet thing and i had a rlly bad panic attack. So i started having a panic attack in the middle of the event and my friend noticed, he said i can see you shaking so he said for me to go see the officer in charge and i tried to tell him it will pass but they basically forced me to go witch made me feel more anxious. When i sat down everybody started crowding me and putting ice packs on me because they thought i was just overheated. everybody told me to take off my blouse and my cover and started taking off my uniform and that just made it worse. i tried to tell them but they brought the EMTs witch made it even worse. they were not very nice the EMT guy looked at my heart rate and said it was abnormally high and i started to freak out at this point. I asked him if anything was wrong and he just said it was a little high. i started to panic a bit less and my HR went back down to normal and i just kinda sat their and said i was fine and tried to keep my composure.&#x200B;Just thought i would get that off my chest.-Currently almost 2.5 weeks off Lexapro, have been having pretty bad withdrawal symptoms. Wondering what other people did to help with withdrawal symptoms? Are there any natural alternatives to alleviate symptoms?-I’ve tried a whole bunch of shit without success however I still wanna try what’s left and perhaps retry a few things. I’ve been on a few different ssris, one snri, a trycyclic, few different atypical antipsychotics as add ons to the AD’s, gabapentin, some anticonvulsants and idk what else couple other things. I’m just wondering if I’m missing something or my doc is missing something. Also anyone else here try a bunch of shit and not respond to anything?-I always get nervous that I forgot to do something like turning off my car when I leave it or locking the door. Is that just forgetfulness or is that anxiety.-I understand that Alochol does make Anxiety worse in the long run, but I am tired of depending on beer just to make me give a shit about things. I wish there was a medication out there that could give me the relaxing effects of Alcohol without making me tipsy. Does anyone know what is the best Medication for me? I am unmotivated, depressed, and Anxious every time I am in a social gathering. I just want to be put on something to make me feel relaxed and content, so I don't have to have a few beers just to feel uplifted and motivated. I have tried Pregabalin, and that only makes me feel slightly relaxed, but I still don't give a shit about anything, and I am still trapped in this shell I have been stuck in for the last decade.-Hi team. First post… Does anyone else get stuck in that anxious cycle of being too depressed to hang out with friends or leave the house, which in turn makes you anxious that constantly saying “no” to hanging out with friends will make them stop asking you/hate you, then the thought of that just makes you feel so down? My state is currently in lockdown so that’s a good excuse to not go… however we are able to go out for “exercise” for up to 2 hours. Even then when my friends try to organise something like that I end up saying I can’t go because I’m too anxious to leave the house or too depressed to get out of my bed. It’s a hopeless cycle…-So this is my first post and sorry for mistakes, English is not my first language.So since two months my boyfriend an I have a rescue dog but in these months where we adopted him a lot of things happened that were very unforeseeable and made me very anxious and tense.So my dog was probably abused in some pointed of his life and is kinda anxious around humans and new places. We have a trainer for it and he has gotten so much better, but there's still a lot to work on. So yesterday the trainer talked to me (again) and told me that I was being to anxious and tense (again) so that my dog can't relax. That if I want to help him and want to make progress, I have to be less tense. Afterwards I tensed up more and now every damn time I interact with my dog I try to be as relaxed as possible but trying that I tense up even more.And now I am in a spiral trying my best, tensing up, overthinking that ia am bad for him, then trying to do better to be the owner he deserves and so on.So if anyone has tips dealing with a dog with anxiety while having anxiety yourself, I would be very glad for advice.-Hi everyone!About 3 months ago, my wife's mental health broke down due to an event that she found particularly traumatic. I believe it was caused by a build up over time of anxiety. She is now getting help from a psychologist and psychiatrist however one of the symptoms she has discovered is she feels like her skin is burning when being touched. It doesn't happen when our kids or pets touch her but it happens when I touch her, or her mother (and maybe other adults, I'm not sure).Last night she tried to force herself to hold my hand but she could only last 2 minutes and then had to stop. She said it literally felt like her skin was burning.Has anyone else experienced something like this?-Recently I’ve lost 30 pounds, that I have put on from taking lexapro about a year ago. Now that I feel better about my body, my social anxiety happens to be getting even worse unfortunately. I’ve been recommended Zoloft but I am TERRIFIED of gaining weight. I really don’t want to. I know antidepressants make you drowsy and lower energy. So I need to know this information before I start taking Zoloft.-Yesterday morning in class I said something and my teacher snapped at me out of nowhere. She had asked a question and I said that it was vague (because I always try to answer the questions and participate in class but it’s difficult to answer a question if I don’t know what she’s asking) and she snapped at me saying that I had been “coming for her all morning” and “muttering things under my breath” and that I’m done talking and I had no idea what she was talking about. I tried to say that it was just a vague question and I don’t know how to answer a vague question but she cut me off and said “no we’re done.” I tried to stop myself but I was only able to hold back a panic attack for like ten seconds. As soon as it started she told me that I should leave the classroom (and my friend asked a minute later if she could come out to check on me and she did). I ended up going to the LRC (the learning resource center) to calm down. (I had taken the SAT and ACT in there because I have extended time and frequent breaks and the person who proctored my tests said that I could come there if I was feeling overstimulated in school). Anyway I haven’t seen that teacher since yesterday morning when I had the panic attack and my friend told me that she’s going to talk to me next week. The only thing I can think of that could’ve set her off is that I said earlier (in a very polite way) that something she was doing may not have been the best thing (she was messing with my friend who also has anxiety about stuff that was important to her, the same friend who came out to check on me).I don’t understand how either of these things could have caused this reaction and I’m a senior now but I’ve had a relatively good relationship with this teacher since tenth grade. Does anyone have any advice on how to handle the situation?(I put this under need a hug/support because I guess needing help/advice is needing support).-A few years ago I loved sewing and was apart of a group of people who enjoyed sewing historical clothing. After a painful breakup that resulted in the loss of those relationships and even five years on it’s hard to sew. It’s painful, like a stabbing sensation on my stomach and a feeling of pointlessness. I even sold or packed up most of my related possessions to avoid looking at them. How do I enjoy my old hobby again? I picked up a needle and thread to just start doing it and it’s like running uphill to finish a seam.-This next big chunk of text is me venting about my anxiety so feel free to gloss over this lolI got prescribed Paxil when I was 15 and stayed on it for 6 years. I decided to taper off last summer because I felt like I was fine, knew how to cope, and knew the anxiety I used to feel was just me overreacting at things. I was so rational, motivated, and normal on Paxil. I knew what I wanted to do in my future, had hobbies, good grades, worked two jobs, interned, and volunteered. Well fast forward to me tapering of in spring 2020, I was officially done with the med august 2020… then covid got worse and my boyfriend got sick. Queue my anxiety getting heightened. I was scared for my diabetic dad. Then February came and I switched my major just as I got accepted into a university after spending 4 years at community college. I was so lost with my future.  In June I knew I needed help and was feeling suicidal from the anxiety. I couldn’t handle it. I called the crisis line like 5 times in a month. I convinced myself I had cancer and was going into a spiral everyday. I finally started seeing a therapist late June. She’s great, but I still feel impending doom. Whenever I drive, I convince myself I’m going to die. Whenever I have a stomach ache, I convince myself I’m going to have diarrhea in public (anxiety gave me very bad IBS) and because of this I pop pepto bismol and Imodium like candy ruining my natural digestive process. I also have a chronic bladder problem where I have to pee like 20 times a day and constantly feel like I have a UTI and I’m going to pee myself in public. It’s ruined traveling, Disneyland, and driving long distances for me. But I feel like anxiety made this problem worse, as my bladder was fine when I was on Paxil.I have a fear of eating and have convinced myself food is going to make me sick. So I regularly just live off of toast or pasta with vegan butter and salt. Anxiety is creating a lot of fears for me I need to stop in it’s tracks (like driving, going to concerts, theme parks, traveling) I am genuinely considering selling my Hamilton tickets I was so excited for because of my anxiety about my IBS and bladder. ~end of anxiety life story~I’m just so scared to go back on Paxil. I was still me on the drug. I just was more calm and collected. The only bad thing was getting off of it. That was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. I’m also scared how it will affect my relationship with my boyfriend and I. I read something that said SSRIs make people fall out of love?? What??? Granted, I don’t think this will happen as my boyfriend and I met when I was on Paxil. I continued to be on it for a year, I tapered off of it with his support. Plus I love him more than anything lol. I feel so guilty sometimes the way I treat him because of my anxiety. I get so irritable because I’m anxious and I constantly need his support. I question that he loves me and will never leave me. It must be so exhausting for him. I just feel defeated. I was only able to last a year off of the drug and here I am crawling back begging to be medicated. But I can almost see the future of my ibs, bladder illness, agoraphobia, health anxiety, and fear of driving (I can’t be scared of driving, I live in Southern California!!) consuming me if I don’t put a stop to this soon enough. I’m only 23 I have so much left in lifeWondering if anyone has experience with this, sorry for the long write up, I don’t see my therapist until Monday and needed to vent now :D-I had my first panic attack and was taken to the ER by my father. I was all nervous for my exam but excited too. Thirty minutes before the exam, I experienced what felt like death. In the ER I was assured by the others that everything was fine. After taking a few medications, I was alright. However, none of my friends checked up on me. I hoped that after having recurring panic attacks for three days and not attending college, somebody would notice. I feel so frustrated knowing that i’m the only one who cares.-Okay, so i’ve had major health scare issues that caused my anxiety to skyrocket. I’m a hypochondriac. After my test results showed abnormal i panicked although it isn’t that serious. Now all of a sudden, conveniently, i’m having these symptoms:1. Constant floating feeling, feels like i’m floating even when i’m sitting down?2. Breathless when walking and get tired. I’m more tired than usual now.3 I wake up with heart palpitations and extreme worry. 4. Constipation and gurgling stomach. Also heart palpitations while walking. By the way, this is someone with major anxiety. Anyone else relate? Please let me know! It would ease my panic.-I was hanging out with a friend last night. Like always he wanted to make-out and blow him. I was in the mood and asked if we could do it. We ended up having sex. He is experienced but I had never done it. Like an hour after we were done I knew I fucked up. I am not on birth control and we didn't use a condom because neither one of us had one. I do impulsive stuff all the time. Now I'm freaking out for obvious reasons. Wtf? What if I get pregnant? Why am I like this?-Work and the future are a big source of anxiety for me. I’m 26 now and I feel so worthless most of the time, though all the people I connect and see in life, think the opposite of me, like I’m intelligent and “good”.I was always a perfectionist and started  to study engineering a few years back, but it was to much for me back then and the stress.Right now I’m doing another apprenticeship, and maybe want to go back to study next year or the year after.But I feel so much behind in life.I need to do an internship and just calling or applying is such a huge source of stress and anxiety for me, just a huge problem. So I suppress.I just wish, I would improve and some day, be “normal”. But right when I think I improved, everything seems to get worse again.I know this is life on hard mode, as I read here :)But what can I do, should I speak with a therapist again, looking if I maybe have AvPD or social anxiety …I just want to be better with things work and social related, so I can handle studies, work and love a good life.-I needed a place to vent this out since my gf is in college and everyone in my house is asleep. >!So im not ranting, and to some it up. Last night i had a nightmare where i was on a school trip and i ended up being r\\*\\*\\*d and tortured by one of school teachers. !<I cant get it out of my head, i think there were some serious metaphors for my past in there and i feel like i wanna cry. Sorry if this is the wrong place im still  pretty new to posting on reddit.-Yeah, I think I convinced myself I’m hearing a sound. My hearing is great, I’ve had multiple tests done and all of them came back fine. The more I look into tinnitus, the more I hear this sound even though I don’t have damage to my ears according to the doctor. Anyone else ever convince yourself you have something even though tests prove otherwise? 🥴-Hey guys, I’ve suffered with anxiety for years and above panic attacks above everything my biggest frustration is constantly feeling like my friends hate me or don’t like me If they respond weirdly or don’t use the usual emoji’s my mind instantly goes to they hate me. It’s made even worse by the fact that I always rant to them about things and I’m always scared they’re getting tired of me. It’s becoming so unbearable I can’t handle it anymore. The worst part of my anxiety at lest is believing the whole world and your loved ones are against you, even if they aren’t Anyone got any advice?-Hello, When I have anxiety I sort of feel like I am gonna faint / have low blood pressure. Like, when my anxiety is at its worst, I have to lie down and put my raise my legs.The thing is that I do not know how to breathe properly to avoid it since I do not know if I am missing oxygen or if I have breathing to much.....Also, wearing a mask makes it worse because I feel like I can't breathe normally and it makes me focus on it.What do you guys think ?-I found a post on kiwifarms. I don't use that website, I don't frequent those types of communities. They found someone by aligning what little pictures the person posted. The reflection off of certain items. It... was a lot. It was scary. It made me so paranoid. It reminded me of that man who found a Japanese idol from the reflection of her eyeballs. My anxiety is going nuts. I never want to gain a following. I want to go off the grid. I'm just spiraling.-Hello! Ever noticed how sometimes a random muscle, or your eye lids just have a random twitch during the day? Like an erratic pulse. Well, I've been having that on my eyes, mostly the left eye, but also in my left ear. I suppose the eye twitch means I'm tired, which would make sense.. But what about the twitch feeling inside my ear? Anything to be worried about?-I’m not sure if this is the right place to say this but here goes nothing.. Recently, I have moved into a new apartment and am a full time college student. When I first moved in, of course it was hard leaving my family, but I was pretty much at peace. Since then, I have become more and more busy with school assignments to the point where all i do is work. I want to take time for myself to just enjoy life again like before but don’t know how. Also, I now despise the apartment and constantly want to go home to my family. Any advice is greatly appreciated and God bless.-I think I'm having a panic attack right now, what should I do? I can't catch my breath, I'm scared! My head feels so light and I feel out of touch-I had a very vivid hallucination I think last night. Something was trying to pull me out if my head. Like imagine a dementor sucking your soul out. Except I couldn't move my body or ask for help. It happened four times in total. My head feels like mush. It's constantly vibrating. I'm scared. I'm scared I've either gone crazy or have some sort of spirit trying to take me.  I Know it's probably the first but I've had so many paranormal experiences that other people have seen      I've had seizures before but this feels different. I can't move. I can't ask for help. I just stay there and hover over my body. Should I try and find a doctor for this or am I just being silly?  I don't want to die like this.-I just moved to a new city several states away from where I've been living for the last 3 years. I had been feeling relatively stable the last year until the last couple months during which I went through some major changes including a breakup (from a pretty toxic person), and now a change of job and residence. I've only been in my new apartment for a couple of weeks so I'm still adjusting, but it's been tough to lose my routine and support network that I had. I don't really know anyone here and I don't start my new job for a few more weeks. All the change and the loneliness has caused my depression and anxiety to return with a vengeance and I'm feeling overwhelmed. Because I'm in a different state and now have different insurance, I will have to find a new psychiatrist and therapist after working with the same people for about 5 years. I'm struggling because as you'd probably expect, at a time when I need these resources more than usual, it's been harder to really get anything done including looking up psychiatrists/therapists and figuring out insurance. I know that it will eventually get better, as it has before, but that doesn't seem to make the present any less difficult. Anyway, I guess I just needed to express all this and hope I can get some support/positivity.-nan-Looking for any recommendations of non-THC cbd oil items that have helped you with your anxiety. I suffer from extreme anxiety, and more often than not, it’s been debilitating and impacting my way of life.I have started drinking 20-30mg CBD coffee and that has seemed to really help. I’m still learning about this, but would it be better to buy the oil itself and put it in food, drinks, etc?I’m likely to end up being on medication once I’m able to see a psychiatrist (recommended by my therapist), but I would love to go organic before diving into medication (done it before but related to anti-depressants and didnt like the side effects).-For like 10 months on and off I’ve been having ear issues. Chronic sore ear pain or stuffy ears 24/7. Crackling and popping when I swallow. And a thumping in my ear from the muscles. Also I’d wake up with slight tinnitus every morning that would get better as the day went by. Also sometimes I’d feel a pressure change in my ear and tinnitus would start up but would only last for like 30 seconds then go away. Lately I fell it’s been getting worse my ears not only hurt but feel more sensitive with loud sounds my ears vibrate now or crackle and sometimes I feel the muscle spasm in ear as well. I’ve been really depressed about this. I going to see a ENT I really can’t take this anymore, does anyone else have an issues like this?-I've been having a lot of Anxiety,  I think I'm anxious every single day of my life. It's hard to deal with life. I'm extremely paranoid, I think it's A reflection of who I used to be. I just sometimes really wish I didn't exist.-So I’ve been on propranolol for a week now, I’m not hyperventilating anymore which I suppose is good. But now instead of having the classic panic attacks, I’m just sort of riddled with periods of anxiety where my body will tense — tight chest or tight muscles elsewhere. Right now my body is so tense with anxiety, I can’t relax. It’s like I can’t release the feelings like a classic panic attack would. So annoying!-Recently, say the past few months, I have finally started to get my anxiety under control. However, today I probably had a little too much espresso so now I'm on high alert.It feels like when my anxiety is high it's almost the same feeling when you are high or drunk and can't snap out it. Like when you are trapped in a room or a car. That feeling kills me. It's such a helpless feeling and you just have to sit in it. I'm getting better at sitting in it. Working though it. Learning from it. But when it happens it doesn't make it suck any less. Just really needed to vent this out into world. Going to go clean and take a shower and do some work because all of thag always seems to help. Thank God for reddit for so many reasons.-Does anyone know how I can forget about it- Hello. I am a 15-years-old Introvert that also has social anxiety. So I have this one friend that is a good. Me and her have known each other for years now but have only started getting closer and started chatting alot (Keep in mind this entire story does not include anything that happened in real life it's only online). So slowly I started getting used to her because we chat alot so then my guard went down and I am not too much of an introvert with her. In chat. But at times I try to be friendly with her since she always makes me happy aswell. So usually when she sends me a picture of herself and asks what I think I try to support her and compliment her with compliments like You look cute, You have a nice smile and etc. But after doing that I always just get myself worried since I feel I am being too friendly which could be a problem since I don't want her to think I like her as anything other than just a really close friend since that's not my intention here. Also at times I could apologize for talking too much since I really enjoy talking to her but I wanna make sure I am in the good side by apologizing since I am worried something wrong happens. I also apologize alot if I do something wrong because once again I don't wanna lose her, her being my only closest friend who is a girl. But then I feel worried maybe apologizijg too much is annoying and it's just a never ending loop. I also usually take no time to reply to her which I heard isnt too good to do. But I am also quite worried since school starts soon for us and she also wanted to play games together but I am not really used to talking to girls since as said she is my only close friend who is a girl And I would be so much more of an introvert IRL or in a call. Since I don't wanna be too awkward. She is an introvert aswell but less than me. I just don't always know if she started hating me or not.. It's painful. Sorry for the long story, Help if you can.-The other night I heard my mom and her boyfriend arguing through the walls of my house, he started to complain about me and then went off for about two-two and a half hours about everything that he hates and that everyone hates about me. I have diagnosed bipolar depression and anxiety and it felt like my emotions shut off after about 10 minutes of him yelling. And then after the fight my mom came into my room and tried to talk to me and my vision started to tunnel up and when I tried to speak it felt like my vocal chords were stuck, I lifted my hands from the keyboard and they started to go numb and I couldn't move them and when trying to close them it felt like all my blood was leaving my hands and they started to cramp up completely, I wasn't able to feel my skin or muscles, but I could feel my bones in my hands and my fingers. It was definitely the worst feeling I had ever felt. My mom explained to me that I was hyper-ventilating. I have to say it was very very scary and really put into perspective how your emotions can literally make you physically hurt and make you feel like you're dying. I'm posting to see if anyone has ever had this happens to them and if the feeling was the same?-Someone I know have this feeling that people are talking bad about him all the time, insulting him, criticizing his clothes or the way he clean the house or things like that. Suffering from anxiety and it goes all the way that he cannot go out of home anymore. When we are together, I don’t hear the same stuff, it’s just him, that’s why I think it’s just part of the anxiety. Anyone with similar experiences?Any tip?-I suffer so badly with heart anxiety mainly because I get palpitations a lot. After having about 5 ecgs, chest x ray, a 7 day holter monitor and maybe 5/6 blood tests since the start of last year and being told it’s all anxiety related I started to take upon myself to do some light exercise. With the encouragement of my counsellor and boyfriend, I started doing walks. It was only for 3 mins at first, then 5, then 7/8 and then I walked 1.09km this morning which was amazing for me. It took 12:56 minutes. I had a smart watch on me and started using it on my walks and all along my heart rate was normal and not going so high (I thought all along it was). Highest I think I seen it go on the walk was 140bpm. That’s so good for a 23 year old. I advise anyone that was like me fearing to even get their heart rate up. Start off small and build yourself up that’s what I did. Hope this helps someone 🤍-So, I got my 2nd dose of covid-19 vaccine on the 23rd, I got moderna After I got it I noticed some weird heart rhythm, it cause me anxiety but it was gone the next dayToday I’ve had minor chest pains, and now as I was about to fall asleep I felt my heart slow down and i immediately thought that I will now die in my sleepCould this happen? Or is it just my anxiety messing w me? Should I get a doctor or is it nothing to worry about?Thankful for answers-My anxiety and lack of motivation has been so bad lately the only place I feel some relief is just laying in bed. My wife is out of town today so it is just me and the kids. They keep asking when I am getting up and I am telling them that I’m just not feeling great today. Feeling pretty ashamed.-Any tips on how to get out of a huge derealization phase? I’ve been in it for WEEKS, and I can’t get out. I have moments where I feel (somewhat) normal but for the most part, all day everyday feels like I’m in a simulation lol. I’m a mom too so I NEED to figure this out. It makes me feel so out of it, with no motivation to do anything like cleaning the house, going to the gym, or doing anything with my son. And it causes me to spiral into a huge panic attack that will last almost all day because of the feeling it gives me. I’m also on Zoloft 50 mg a day, this has been happening since before that though. Please help me feel normal again. 🥺-So I bought a book the other day that use low-intensity CBT techniques to treat agoraphobia. I've been slowly working through it and I'm feeling positive but it's only been a week & things take time.Today I was supposed to attend a family gathering but even with taking my anxiety meds (which usually help), I still couldn't leave my house.I just don't know how I’m going to move on from this current state of anxiousness. I used to be a relatively social person who’d study, go to work, see my friends regularly, travel by myself & take random trips to places.Three years later (i.e. Now) I’m a shell of myself, I have no friends, I can’t work due to anxiety & other MH conditions & my future doesn’t look bright if this continues.If anyone’s reading this who’s overcome agoraphobia, how did you do it? Do you have any advice?Thanks in advance!-So I grew up anti-vax. And so as an adult (33), I still am not vaccinated. I did my research and personally stopped being anti-vax about 8-10 years ago, but never got around to getting my shots up to date.It’s a combo of things: fear of needles, and the ingrained fear of adverse reactions - plus having a history of weird and rare adverse reactions to different medications.Well, I’ve finally hit the bullet and have an appointment to begin the modified adult vaccination schedule. And I’m super anxious about it. It’ll be in about 1.5 weeks.The only vaccine I’ve had is the COVID vaccine (signed up the day I became eligible), and didn’t have too bad a reaction (worst in the household, but all normal). I did have multiple anxiety attacks surrounding them, though.Just worried about it, and know I’m going to start having worse anxiety attacks the closer I get.-What’s the worst thing that could happen? I will definitely go to a doctor and ask but I’m looking for general answers and opinions online before I go.-I need some help, advises from people that actually used xanax as a medical treatment for anxiety and panic attacks / and major fear of throwing up in public, and not for recreational usage. (Sorry for my english not my main language)&#x200B;So  trying to keep the story short and focus on the issue, I have a mild level of agoraphobia which usually starts when I go out, after few hours Im mostly alright with barely any anxiety/panic attacks but the first hours outside its really bad, with panic attacks, breathing, the sensation of the heart pounding and the worst feeling that is nauseas and sometimes when its really bad throwing up.I went to a psychiatrist which I dont feel he was quite professional it was a 10 min appointment in which he reccomended me to takeVortioxetine 15mg one before a mealAlprazolam 1/2 mg 3 times a day.When I read the diagnose I felt it was really strong for my case. Im depressed but I do not believe I have a major depressión, on the other hand my panic attacks I understand needing some sort of pills for that but not sure if thats a good start, 3 times a day.&#x200B;Anyway I contacted another doctor which he reccomended starting on alprazolam 1/2 mg one  before going to sleep  (Im really curious if anybody knows that taking one alprazolam before going to sleep helps the anxiety of the next day when going out?) and having one pill on my backpack anywhere I go just in case, and leaving aside the anttidepressant until I start therapy and see how major is my depression.Any answers with some personal experience or medical experience will truly help me out making a choice about this, Im rather desperate and I need to make a choice soon.&#x200B;I do want to start the alprazolam choice using the option of one before going to sleep to help next day anxiety going out, but Im a bit scared about the addiction and side effects of it.-Yeah. Anxiety. It's ruining my life. So here's the deal; I got an offer to go on a little vacation for free for a few days. (Going out of state to spend a few days with my boyfriend and his family) And I get to decide when I want to do this. All I have to do is say the word. Now anyone would probably love an opportunity like that, but my anxiety prevents me from being excited/happy about this.I really do want to go badly, but guess what? My anxiety causes physical problems, so bad to the point I shut down and cannot even communicate for the life of me. Yep, you read right. I literally mentally shut down like a robot. Then I can't stop shaking, feeling like I'll hurl, get diarrhea, stomach pain. Ugh, my stomach just goes crazy. And it's like that the ENTIRE trip. I get no break. I end up having the worst time of my life. I'm even sick just thinking about this vacation. It does it no matter what I do... I can go to the grocery store or talk on the phone/video chat and get sick from the anxiety of it. I was so excited to finally get to go the beach this summer and I ended getting sick on the beach from the anxiety... and the main problem is the diarrhea. And it just causes MORE anxiety. It's been like this since I was a little kid, but recently it got worse. It used to be I just FELT like I had to go to the bathroom, but now I actually get diarrhea and feel like absolute garbage during and for days after the trip.And I already have stomach problems all the time... but the stomach issues is making my anxiety much worse... and vice versa. I just don't know what to do anymore... I want to do things, go on vacations, or even just do something as simple as going to a store without getting sick af... I'm fed up. And I don't even know where to begin to help/stop this? PLEASE. PLEASE. If anyone has gone through this and has an effective way to help, PLEASE share! I want to take back control of my life and not constantly live in a state of fear and anxiety. (I also do not know the cause of it... I'm not even scared of people? My thoughts are not even running wild, I just get physically sick from it? It's weird. It's like subconscious anxiety. Even if I don't think about it.)((And PLEASE for the love of God, do NOT tell me to get a therapist. I'm so fed up with hearing that...)-I’ve had bad anxiety from being a small kid. Like random panic attacks in public, troubles in school because I didn’t know how to act around people or if they felt the same way. Over the years, I’ve learned to control my anxiety in different ways and dealt with the fact that it will probably never leave me fully. The last year has been great. I got rid of people who caused me stress, making my anxiety 100x worse, I started a degree, I’ve met someone. But it just comes trickling back like it sees you’re happy and needs to destroy that. Over the past few weeks, I’ve felt my self slipping and had the occasional bad day here in there. But tonight I’ve had a full blown, manic, breathless panic attack and I’m not sure where to go from here. I’m so stubborn to the fact that I need help and taking tablets etc will help me but I just feel like once you go down that road, you’re acknowledging that you’re not good and it’s acceptance. I’ve tried meditation, yoga, that calm app thing. I have hobbies and pastimes that allow me some escape but I just want to feel good again. Stress free, love myself again. Help me.-I have jury duty Monday and I’m anxious af about it! God help me!-My anxiety has gotten better over the years, but I still let “scary” things pile up and then get more anxious about them the more I let them build (y’all know how it is!) But, once in a while, I will get a burst of confidence and knock five things off my scary list at once. For example, the other day I set up a doctors appointment, resolved something with my pharmacy, submitted a maintenance ticket, got an estimate for a car repair, opened an email I had been avoiding, and dug into an intimidating project at work. That’s more than I can typically handle in a month. Does anyone else get this? Is there a way to harness the power?- *A truly good man does nothing,**Yet leaves nothing undone.***Lao Tzu**&#x200B;*Bojack Horseman* is a TV show about a self-destructive sitcom actor from the 90s.On the day of his new movie premieres, he’s torn apart by anxiety. As he’s trying to relax in his jacuzzi, his friend Todd comes around.“Hey buddy, big day?”“No…” “Big premiere day?”“Stop.”“Secretariat in theaters now. How exciting?”“Please stop.”“People are seeing your movie, forming opinions, judging you all over the country.” “Why are you doing this?”“Or no, maybe nobody is seeing it? Wouldn’t it be weird if nobody saw your movie?”“How do I get out of this conversation?”“By this time tomorrow we’ll know if it’s a hit or a flop. The air crackles with possibilities!” “Oh, good lord…”Bojack slowly drowns himself in the tub…This is a very familiar dialogue for people with anxiety and overthinking. Our b\\*tch of an inner voice constantly pokes at our insecurities much like Todd’s, imaginatively escalating our worries beyond control.Anxiety is always unsettling. It catches us off guard, and quickly surges into overwhelming sensations. If we let it, it’ll control and consume our lives.Now, don’t confuse anxiety with fear. fear is real sh\\*t. It’s a vital reaction in face of a threat. Fear keeps you alive in acute physical emergencies, by triggering the fight or flight response. When we’re afraid, our heart rate increases, our senses are enhanced. Colors become vivid. Everything happens in slow motion, yet occurs so fast like in a John Woo movie. Summoned in a healthy dose, fear will give you the swift edge you need in the short term and the dedicated motivation in the long run. It shows care and concern for those you love. It allows for judgement and resolution, accompanied by energy and focus.### “Nothing… the silent killer…”Problems arise when fear becomes a self-perpetuating condition rather than a coping function. Instead of either fight or flight, we then get paralysis. When feeling incapable of handling the situation, we become anxious. We even start dreading our anxiety… We get anxious about getting anxious. We worry about worrying.The root cause of anxiety is the fear of losing control. Our health, jobs, relationships, status… Everything can slip in a moment. We can never know what the future will bring. So, we create stories in our minds to feel a sense of control over our lives. Because if we imagine scenarios in our heads, we feel in charge. Like a kid playing with Action-Man and Barbie figures… Except in our version of the story Action-Man suffers a divorce, Barbie gets unemployed, and both of them fail to pay their mortgage!You see, we tend to exaggerate and catastrophize uncertainties. Every little doubt turns into a wildfire of escalating what ifs. Woody Alan once wrote, “I am plagued by doubts. What if everything is an illusion and nothing exists? In that case, I definitely overpaid for my carpets!”These what ifs never relate to the present. They’re either about the past or the future, but they still somehow feel more real than the present. Mark Twain jokingly stated that “I’ve lived through some terrible things in my life, some of which actually happened.” So, ask yourself: · What is bothering you?· Does it exist beyond your imagination?· Will it really matter in 5 years? In 5 days? In 5 minutes?There’s a scene in the TV show *Parks and Recreation* where obsessively hypochondriac Chris thinks he’s fatally sick. After getting some tests, he gravely shares the results with his friends.“The test and blood work came back and the news is terrible. They found nothing.”“Nothing?“Nothing. The silent killer.”Our brains are wired to constantly look out for negatives. They constantly compare our situation with alternative outcomes and then tune into the worst possible one. Erring on the safe side keeps us alive. As Guru Laghima from *The Legend of Korra* says, “Instinct is a lie, told by a fearful body, hoping to be wrong.” No caveman ever died because he thought a twig was a snake. But if you ignore a snake, thinking it’s a twig, good luck ever finding a prehistorical hospital!So nature knowingly tricks us. As neuroscientist Hanson says, “The brain is like Velcro for negative experiences but Teflon for positive ones.”It overestimates threats so we can take them seriously. It underestimates opportunities so we can get our butts off the couch. To a healthy degree, threats are a great motivator. If you’re terrified of performing your trombone concerto in front of an audience, chances are you’ll start working you’re as\\* off! And if you realize there are only 5 weeks left, you will work even harder!The problems start when this negativity bias gets exaggerated. Overloaded by possible negative outcomes, our brains get hyper stimulated. They start building up conspiracy theories about ourselves. As Alain de Botton says, “Happiness is generally impossible for longer than fifteen minutes.”Imagine this. It’s a pleasant evening. You come home and start practicing on your trombone—loving the groove and enjoying every minute of your flow. All of a sudden, doubt creeps in out of nowhere.“What if my trombone slide gets stuck in the middle of the concert?” Even better….**“**What if my trombone slide gets stuck in the middle of the concert and the maestro kicks me out in front of everyone?”Or even better…**“**What if my trombone slide gets stuck in the middle of the concert and the maestro kicks me out in front of everyone and then I realize I forgot to wear pants?”Oh boy! You realize how this logic plays out like a teenage nightmare. In this sense, imagination is our worst enemy. See, what we really have here is not fear. Fear is always about something immediate, something that is happening now. But anxiety is about what “may happen.” We create these narratives in our heads and then surrender our sanity to them. It is like finding ourselves in a horror movie… Except we write the scripts, we hate the guy playing the trombone and we absolutely make sure that he doesn’t live for long!\\------If the community is interested, I'd be more than happy to share the 2nd part of this chapter in a follow up post.-My mother is proving to be a huge trigger for my anxiety and I just don't know how to set better boundaries with her. If I tell her to ease off because I'm loving overseas and have a life/things going on, I just know she's going to get upset. I just don't even have the capacity to deal with that outcome right now because I've been so busy with work but constantly putting her off is exhausting too.For added context, unfortunately my mother also suffers from anxiety and I didn't know to create those boundaries when I was younger.Any advice would be appreciated-So I'm dealing with some issues that really affect me and make me anxious. My mom invited me to accompany her to go out. I am debating myself if I should go because while I think distracting myself and being proactive will be very good for me instead of staying home and crying, but I also feel afraid I will suddenly feel very anxious or start crying in public or feel unable to do anything. This is something I usually struggle with. Does someone goes through something similar? What is the best choice?-Well the basics are that I haven't had panic attacks for a long time. Now my body feels calm but my mind is racing and showing me: You feel weird? Dying. What if ambulance will come like almost a year ago, what if this time it'a real. And I can't for the life of me stop those thoughts. Thanks for reading this far.Also know that even if you're struggling, you'll get trough it and everything will be fine.-I’m not looking for benzo.. I took them for months daily and it did help so much but I know it’s not safe.. I have PRN twice a week and it’s the only moment few hours of mental peace I get. I have tried several anxiety anxiety medications with no luck.. my doctor won’t prescribe me anything even though I have crippling anxiety. I can’t wait for a new doctor.. how can I find someone else fast..? I heard some stuff about online doctors? Thanks.-Whenever I mess up with somebody or something I always feel like I always need closure. Recently I was in a situation where I messed up with somebody and I said sorry but they didn’t accept it. The thing is, I know what this person is like. They’re not the type to forgive easily and I didn’t expect them to forgive me but it still hurt for some reason.-I’ve been feeling a lot of “itching” under my skin when anxious. Has anybody felt this? If so, what helped you?-Hey guys, i live in NYC and I’ve had bad anxiety of leaving the house over the years because the neighborhood I live in is full of sick perverts. I can’t even walk one block without being hit on and it’s always by gross old men, ppl say to ignore it but it does make women anxious especially when it’s men in groups. Three weeks ago I was walking with my cousin and a crazy guy started following us and I crossed the street to go inside a salon to get away from him. When i went to open the door, he grabbed me and spit on me. We called the police and they never came, but the ppl at the salon chased him. Ever since that I’m more scared to leave the house and I get nervous about being followed or attacked. I don’t even want to go to the park across the street, my cousin said to speak to a therapist but wow they’re expensive.-So I had a CT angiogram with contrast (so they injected a dye) on Thursday noon. I had no immediate reaction (except the hot feeling for like 40 seconds).On Thursday night, I developed hives all over my body and had to go to ER for monitoring. They gave me Zyrtec and I was fine after a couple hours. Doctor told me it could be a delayed adverse reaction to the contrast.I’m now worried that if I will have any more side effects. I heard it could cause irreversible kidney damage, and the delayed side effects could happen for up to a week (so I have 5 more days to get through from now). I also heard it could cause cardiac arrest; and I’m really really hoping it won’t cause that - anyone here that can help me?-Hey, so I myself am suffering from anxiety since the time I can remember, but all I heard from my parents and family members was that I feared a lot (was a coward in other words). And I thought I was like that I didn't know that it was a suffering from GAD until recently when I just wanted to die. I searched for my symptoms online and found out I had GAD. Since then I have been doing a lot of research about it ...reading books, videos , etc. From this I realised that even my younger brother (21) was also going through Depression. All the symptoms indicate it and he always speaks of how death brings peace. We have lost 3 very close uncles and my grandmother in a span of 5 years. We both were very young to process those emotions and I feel that is what is causing him us these problems. I tried to reach out to him many times in the past and I am actively trying but he doesn't open up . I  told him what I was going through for that he was very supportive and insisted on me going to therapy and all. But when I even straight up told him that he too had Depression, he just ignores it and says that he doesn't. But I know for sure that he does because he keeps taking about death and he doesn't go out , doesn't have any friends and I have never seen him laugh. He is cranky a lot and keeps hitting walls and breaking stuff. I even told him to go to a therapist and sent him sources to cope up but he's not following those. It's like he doesn't want to be helped and just wants to die. After all this I don't know what to do now, my mother is very religious and believes this is all black magic and Satan's doing. Please help me help my brother. I love him a lot and I don't want to see him suffering like this.Sorry the post is too long but I would appreciate any help I get .-Hi!So this past week has been really tough for me. I started to notice some visual disturbances last friday. I’ve been having floaters, flashes, and then my peripheral vision is like static/ fuzzy and shaky sometimes? I’m just curious if anyone else deals with  visual disturbances or not. I’ve had myself convinced I have a brain tumor or something due to these symptoms.I don’t really have any other symptoms along with the visual stuff besides dizziness, which I’ve been dealing with for a few years now, so nothing new there. I have no idea why the first thought when i’ve been having these symptoms is something in my brain but the anxiety i’ve been feeling is insane. I’ve wanted to go to the ER a few times, but with covid I’m nervous to do so, and i’m just nervous in general to find out anything potentially bad. I just try to reassure myself it’s my anxiety but then my mind starts wondering what if it’s not your anxiety, it’s a crazy cycle. I figured i’d post here and see if anyone can relate or has dealt with the same thing.-I was recently found out I had anxiety and I am super anxious and stressed out about it and I was wandering if there is any good techniques you guys have on helping manage calm the anxious feelings-I felt head tremors twice this week I think due to my anxiety. I feel the tremors in my hands and chest sometimes too. Is there anything I can do to treat these tremors naturally? Do they progressively worsen? I'm due for my second covid shot in a few days and concerned now because of the head tremors. Anyone else get these tremors?-So i think more than a week ago. I posted about having this anxiety and how i get bloated then it would lead to not being able to breath then would lead to an attack. Its a vicious cycle. I did some research and read an article on having a healthy gut. Something about mind gut connection. Anyways I started drinking probiotics. It took about 2 weeks before I saw some improvements and now the bloating is lessened. I don't know if its placebo but my mom noticed it as well. That my tummy isnt as big as before. There is still some bloating but not as bad as before. I also watch how much food I eat. More veggies too. Then I also started using this app. Helps with meditation. My bpm is usually high. Too much thinking, stress etc. Im on my 6th day today using this meditation app and my bpm is on the 60 to 70 resting. This was hard for me to achieve before. And also it helps with sleep. Even without meds my bpm is at 68 to 75. Small steps i keep on telling myself. Had an anxiety attack a month ago but still feeling the effects. The fear is still there. Once in a while it creeps in but its more manageable now. I bought this herb that I will try and will update you on its effects. Suppose to lessen anxiety and stress. Till next time.-I don't have a god damn comfort zone. I have panic attacks alone in my apartment in bed. Going to work every day is so outside my comfort zone that all I can do when I get home is collapse in exhaustion. Going to the kinds of group gatherings everyone seems to think will help me make friends might as well be skydiving, it gives me that much terror. I know this defeatist mindset makes it worse but I feel just completely out of control of my mind and body. I have such a hard time conveying the constant toll that the oppressive, obsessive thoughts, nausea, agonizing chest and stomach pain, migraines, and hot flashes I get from literally just existing around others take on me-I have been taking Buspar for several years now for anxiety (now 15mg 3x a day) and it works wonders. However, due to an upcoming situation I have landed in the hospital twice in the last 2 weeks with severe anxiety attacks. Yesterday they couldn't get my heart rate down even shooting me up with Ativan. So the hospital doc put me on Klonopin twice a day (.5mg) to get me through the next month. I took it last night and slept fantastic, but have been up 2 hours now and still \"hungover\". Is this normal??And has anyone had trouble getting off of it after using it short term??-Anyone else have crippling anxiety over everything? I have always been kind of nervous about things and had some anxiety. It’s gotten to where every little thing feels me with fear though. Rather it be going out in traffic, going out to eat, having a conversation, or anything. I just signed on with a Real Estate company. You have to fill out an application and the Real Estate Commission does a background check on you. You also have to get fingerprints. I have never been in trouble with the law, (Knock on wood.) Yet, I am nervous about the background check. I just always have this fear that something bad is going to happen. Anyone else feel this way?-I’ve been in therapy on and off for about 10 years.  The most recent therapist is really good.  I find myself making progress in that I’m not so focused on the negative aspects of my life and am more solution focused.  That being said, I’m on these medications for depression and I’m still having days where I’m depressed.  I’m not living my life the way I want to.  I’m 32 and Gay and new to the area and I want to meet more gay people and have more friends.  My depression is holding me back from this as I don’t feel confident enough to do this.  I also don’t want to feel so stressed out about work.  I want to have a sex life and these meds make it difficult to do that so I want to eventually get off of them.  If I continue to go to therapy will I be able to accomplish these things or will I continue to have to be on these meds and live this boring life?-I've been dealing with pretty massive anxiety for the last 3 months.  Currently taking Seroquel and it works one day, does nothing the next.  I feel awful today truthfully.  I've kind of realized most of my anxiety is physical related.  Tight chest, nausea, headaches.  I've been reading that Propranolol is great for getting rid of the physical aspects of anxiety.  DAE have success with Propranolol working with what I'm describing?-How does one with anxiety deal with these, especially in a heartbroken context.-I also suffer from anxiety and panic attacks and I want to hear your stories. It makes me feel as if I am not alone in this battle. Thanks-I just could not shut off my brain last night night. It was like my body was actively fighting sleep. I'm currently switching meds. I was on Zoloft for 6 months. Which was not great for me. Now after doing the genesite test, they're trying me on Effexor. I know stopping one SSRI and starting another is always not going to be the smoothest. I just could not calm down last night. I had a headache and my skin almost felt like it was crawling a bit. Are these normal things to expect when switching meds? I'm only 6 days into effexor.-I (M40) am married to an anxious person (F36). She is anxious because of an abusive childhood, and it manifests in a lot of different ways. She does a lot of catastrophizing and the worst is her imagined medical issues. She will stub her toe and think it will result in her having to have her leg amputated which will result in me leaving her which will result in her death, etc. Her main trigger is imagined cancer. If her shoulder hurts, if her side hurts, if her chest hurts, if she has period cramps, if she has a headache, etc. anything will make her think it's secretly cancer and she is 100% going to die. We know that she behaves this way as a way to protect herself, to keep her \"alert\" of a threat. We also know some of the anxiety might be alleviated by regular physical check ups, but of course we're American and thus don't have health care. (She also has some issues with medical situations/doctors that also causes anxiety.)  We are working on the doctor situation, but I know that won't solve everything since we can't just go to a doctor for every bruise and stomachache.She loses a lot of sleep every night fantasizing about how she's dying, how this is the last four hours of her life, how I'll react when I wake up to her dead, or how I'll react if she has to go through cancer treatments, etc., etc., etc. She knows she shouldn't think about stuff, but she is incapable of turning off her brain. She will obsess about things for days, and then the cat will playfully bite her and she'll obsess about dying from a cat bite for the next few days until the next thing captures her imagination.She is already in therapy, and she has specifically talked to this therapist (and other, past therapists) about this issue. So far, none of them have given her any useful ways to deal with these intrusive thoughts. She is also incapable of googling how to fix stuff like this because just googling stuff will implant a new fear into her head. (I'm sure some of you know how it is.)What can I do to help? What can she do to help? There are nights she gets very little sleep because she's up all night thinking she's having a heart attack or whatever, which only makes her anxiety worse when she has to get up early for work, etc.  It is really stressful for me, too, both because I can't help, and because I feel like my partner isn't present because she's obsessing over imagined illnesses.Any help is appreciated, thanks.PS this is my first time posting here. If there is a better place for me to post this, please just let me know.-I'm trying to post this on different subs to get an opinion.  My wife hasn't been sleeping well lately due to our nightly nursing toddler, and has been particularly exhausted.  She isn't diagnosed with anxiety but I think she has some form of it. Sometimes when she's stressed or when she's worried about something she'll get nauseous and vomit and diarrhea.  Anyways our son was having a rough night last night and  wife was overtired and nauseous, and commented that whenever she tried going to sleep, her breathing would slow down or even pause and she'd wake up to catch up.  She wasn't waking up choking so she doesn't think its OSA.My question is, has anyone ever had anxiety or panic where they had this issue when trying to sleep?  I've been looking to see if it's central sleep apnea or if it's part of some panic attack she may have had.  Last night was the first time this has happened to her (to our knowledge).-sigh-It has been more than 2 years since I have learned about the truth and I have been trying to forget about the wrongdoings of the person, however I still get reminded of it at times and I feel a lot hatred towards the person. I was deceived and taken advantage of for 6 years, I hate all the memories, moments, time and money I have invested on this person. The worst character I have ever came across and led me to trust issues and distancing from people. The person lacks in every way and is always envious and jealous of others success, wealth and appearance. Constantly boasting, gossiping, and spreading false rumours about people who are more superior, to feel better. Basically pure evil. I can’t comprehend how someone can plot such a despicable plan for years just to destroy another human being who has been genuine and sincere throughout. I was such a fool, blinded and forgiving over and over again. Please take my advice, do not take people lightly, always have your guard up and choose the people around you wisely. Quality over quantity. ‘It is better to be alone than in a bad company’ better to lose than to suffer. Don’t be afraid and stay strong x-I am struggling with severe anxiety and panic attacks. I feel like my family doesn’t support me at all. I always get the “just calm down” responses from them. These are my in laws considering that my actual blood family (my mom; my dad passed away) responds the same way as well. I am having a hard time with day to day things… even going to work. I do my best to hide it but today I really broke down. And the responses that I am getting are hurting me even more. “Oh my god…why are you crying now?” “What’s wrong now?” “I don’t know what to say anymore” These are the people I look towards for support because they are the only people I have. I don’t have any friends which is sad at my age (31). Sometimes I just don’t have anyone to talk to..or be a friend….I feel like I am on my last straw here with my panic attacks and anxiety…..I feel like I am crying out for help with no support besides myself…..I can’t do this anymore…..-Hi Everyone,My dad is in the ICU on a ventilator. Needless to say, I am anxious beyond belief. To the point where I can’t eat or  sleep at all. And TMI, but I’m having what I call “anxious pee’s” where I feel like I need to go to the bathroom 24/7, even after I just went.Im already on lexapro, but im wondering if there’s something stronger i can ask my doctor for. Has anyone else ever had to ask for extra anxiety meds during rough times?-Currently I'm studying but I feel like when i finish university and going to work I'll have people constantly testing me or comparing with me, and I know no one will be there for me. I don't know what I'll be working on. If I regret my job? If I just end alone working and not knowing what I really want to do? I see many people working all day every day and I ask myself wether I'll be able to handle it. Uni is sometimes just hard. There's so much people better than me in many ways that i don't know if I will be able to get anything. I'm constantly thinking wether i'll have regrets in the future and I just can't continue like this. It's a so intrusive thought and maybe i'll change my career but maybe I regret that too... I'm starting to think friends are important for me, despite the fact that I don't think anyone is trustworthy. I just don't like it, to think that I'm depended on other people than myself but I can't avoid it and i hate it. They won't even care about me. During this pandemic I lost some contact that I had and it made uni a lot harder. It was just me alone against the courses and I felt hopeless all the time. I could study normally up to 1 and a half semesters but now i feel so much doubts and I don't know anyone to talk about it. My parents are just losers and I think I'll end like them and my few \"friends\" are just doing their thing.  Maybe I don't deserve anything for studying and I have to earn things but it's just I don't feel that I'm ready. I don't trust myself. I was constantly rejected in school and have so much fear. I don't even think i had a childhood. I just feel faint-hearted and that no one will trust me in the future and i can't engage to anything because of my doubts and I keep dissapointing people. I'll end just like my parents and time just keeps passing by. I just want to run away. I just want this pandemic to get over to continue studying by inertia of seeing people doing it in the library.-my social anxiety is horrible. i can handle hanging out with one or two people but anymore makes me so anxious and i just want to leave so desperately. it’s like these alarms in my head start blaring because i know i’m going to have to endure conversation i’m not a part of nor do i know about, inside jokes/references i won’t get and will have to awkwardly listen, etc… now im a very good conversationalist and i am in no way bad at being in a group, but i just hate being there. i can pretend to enjoy myself and drink a beer or something and have forced small talk with people i don’t know, but god i would so much rather be at home stress free. every time i try to hang out with groups of people i just get over looked and ignored every time and after a while i guess i’ve just developed anxiety towards groups because i feel i will be left out. now don’t get me wrong, yes they were bad friends and most friend groups won’t ignore people they bring to hang out, but there my friend is where you are wrong. they’re all the same. i’ve tried and tried to make friends with my peers, younger, older, anyone. everyone just ignores me. i have no friends besides my coworkers. i tried to hang out with them before and they ignored me. i hate it so much, now anytime someone asks me to hang out i get excited and then have to awkwardly make an excuse once i find out all of this persons friends will be there. and i don’t regret it. because i know if i were to force myself to go, i would hate it and be left out trying to get drunk in a corner by myself. god sometimes even the thought of having to endure more social awkwardness makes me want to cry. it makes my soul cringe. and i’ve tried to be that guy who starts conversation when it gets awkward but it seems no one else wants to put in the effort to hold a goddamn conversation. it makes me so mad and sad. now because of my “friends” (who also talked a lot of shit on me during said hangouts), i have social anxiety. i try to be a virtuous and genuine person but it’s just a weak spot to be exploited to everyone else. i just get lied to and tested to my limit just because it’s “fun” for someone else to see me get emotional. i hate everyone. no wonder it’s hard to find good people in the world, they all just get taken advantage of until they realize being bad is the only way to have respect. fuck this society, i don’t want friends anymore because no one cares what i have to say so all i can do is scream into the void and listen to my own insanity.-every morning i wake up with stomach pains and have to use the washroom like 3 times. my mom says it's anxiety and she gets it too. it makes it hard to get ready for school on time. what are some ways i can deal with my morning anxiety? i've been avoiding breakfast bc of it.-For context I'm a high school senior and I'm also autistic.I'm really struggling with not having a safe space/safe person I can go talk to or a safe space to be in when I'm having a panic attack, sensory overload or am just not feeling 100%. By safe person I also mean teacher, because teachers can often be more supportive than the other kids. In terms of safe space, like a classroom or something else.The teacher who used to provide me this support, and did since I was a freshman just left this week and it was extremely sudden. It's been so long with his support and it feels odd without it. His last day I quite literally got home and cried (a bit embarassing I know).I used to seek out support in the student help center that was only open to people with disabilities (like learning disabilities, anxiety, depression, ADHD etc) but that has been opened to everyone this year and I constantly feel judged there. My anxiety and autism are very visible, if something is bugging me everyone is going to know.I just don't know where to go next. Has anyone ever experienced anything like this before? It's just really difficult to not feel like I have to hide everything away for 7 hours at school.-I just got to college. I used to be a really mean person and a bad friend in high school. Over quarantine I had a whole personality revamp and changed myself COMPLETELY because I wanted to be a better, pure person. I think I succeeded in that, because I got to college and was trying my absolute hardest for the first 3 weeks to be nice to all of the new people I was meeting. Everything was going well, I had even started talking to this guy I thought was cute and one of the things he said he liked about me was how caring and comforting I was to be around. This obviously made me happy because this was the goal of my whole personality change over quarantine. This guy is super nice, we weren’t in a committed relationship by any means, we were just talking. But, I fucked up last weekend. I got super drunk when I went out and ended up kissing his friend. Naturally this guy found out and I felt so extremely shitty about it the entire next day. It actually sparked a panic attack for me which made me go home because I couldn’t handle the guilt and anxiety. I ended up talking to the guy in person and we worked everything out- he claimed to not be mad and said he felt like he just wanted to be friends with me for a few days, so he was glad we were having this conversation. However, for the past week since the incident, there has been this god awful, lingering feeling of anxiety in my stomach over this entire situation. Am I a good person still? I try SO HARD to be and I feel like this one mistake set me back light years. I want to give up and literally die, I feel like the shittiest person ever and this feeling of anxiety that comes with is not helping my mental health at the moment. I still hope I’m a good person, my intentions were never to hurt anyone. Had we been in a committed relationship/set boundaries I would never in a million years do something like that.-Hey everybody! I’m an introvert, HSP, and I have an anxiety disorder. It’s always been energetically draining for me to be around people and to be out in the world, even (sometimes especially) when I’m with people I like and doing a fun activity. I just get over-stimulated, which zaps my energy and can trigger my anxiety because I start having thoughts along the lines of, am I going to be able to get out of this situation before I crash/etc. I usually just muscle through it and then go home and collapse.Especially now, in this COVID era when I don’t have as many opportunities to flex my social muscle, I feel the weight of having to go out of my comfort zone and do social things. On the other hand, I want to be a person and maintain my relationships! So, do you guys relate to what I’m describing at all? What tools do you use to deal with it?-My mom is forcing me to ask my teachers to get there letters of recommendation in the next 7 days. That’s a completely unrealistic thing for me to ask seeing that they originally had 20 days. I am terrified bc I will have to ask in person and it took me three months to gain the courage to ask them for the LOR in the first place. I am more scared that in anticipation I will have some sort of nervous breakdown and end up hurting myself-Hello guys! I’ve always suffered from anxiety but I somehow managed to keep it under control. This month my dearest cat, my little kid, my everything, almost died 2 times and we had to run to the vet to save him. He hasn’t recovered fully yet, but he is better now. I spent all my savings and made some pretty big debts to save him and now I find myself struggling with a HUGE anxiety anytime I am alone with him. I always wonder if he is gonna get ill again, where will I get the money from to save him, how am I gonna get to the vet in time and I know it’s all in my head but I just can’t control myself anymore..Did anyone experience something similar and if so, how did you manage to get over it?-As ridiculous as it may sound, a short while ago while I was at my computer I felt pretty dizzy. Now, this was at around 2:30 AM and I'd been looking at my screen for a long time. No symptoms before tonight however, and it has gotten worse since then further scaring me. There's been some on and off pain in my head that comes with the dizziness but I'm not having coordination or balance problems as of now. Any advice would be great because I'm bordering on a panic attack now.-You never know what others are going through.  What is wrong with people nowadays?? This guy put his window down and had the audacity to tell me off, called me something along the lines like \"dumb ass bitch\" despite there being a big, yellow 'Student Driver' sticker on the rear end of the car I was practicing driving in not to mention I was actually driving the limit and following all the rules. Don't do that :'(-What does drug half life actually mean? I am prescribed xanax and this month I switched to klonopin. I take it as needed but sometimes I take it everyday for 1-2 weeks and then quit for a month. Everytime I quit xanax 2-3 days later I get this weird insomnia but it goes away in a few days nothing too serious. I read that xanax half life is pretty short and this is why the withdrawal effects are more severe. This time I am prescribed klonopin which has a 3x times longer half life. So does this mean that if I use this drug for a few weeks and then quit the withdrawal effects will be mild to zero since it's in my system for a longer time and it tapers itself more slowly?Thank you can't find any answer anywhere else.-(24,F) I moved the country from US to UK a year ago, August 2020, to be with my husband and haven’t been able to start work yet or drive, so I have time to sit at home and be worried about everything and moving countries is a big change. I don’t know if I’ve begun to develop ANXIETY but a month ago I started worrying about lumps in my neck and my appt to get the covid vaccine (put it off twice) A few days later, my lower right back started aching really deep while sitting in a car(dont remember feeling anxious at the time), got meds for UTI that took the back pain away on day 5 but came back on day 7 my last day of my meds but even worse pain came back extending to the top of my buttcheek(worse when sitting down) & I started googling and it mentioned cancer & I started freaking out and I think that made the pain worse for weeks and started having more symptoms after googling things (night sweats). Went to the doctor and they did blood tests(normal) checked my back & neck, couldn’t see anything, and put me on the long waiting list for general physician.Since then, I’ve been having cold night sweats that wake me up every night at 3am(some nights worse than others) and feel wide awake but no reason to be sweating, lower back pain(turned into a burning aching feeling), and recently been having random hip aches, stomach rumbling. But my whole life I’ve been a deep sleeper and slept the WHOLE night. I haven’t slept the whole night for the past month due to back pain & soaking my pajamas in the night and realllly miss sleeping the whole night. Just got my FIRST VACCINE yesterday and didn’t look at the side affects (bc I knew I would get them if I looked) and haven’t felt anything) besides the continuous back pain which now radiates up my mid back and night sweats. I’m really hoping the night sweats and back pain go away now that my fear of the vaccine is over. Anyone else think this could be anxiety? Really don’t want to get on anxiety pills but waking up from night sweats/back pain for a month straight worries me. I’m not having nightmares(that I know of) but can you have night sweats from purely being stressed out this long?How could your back start aching really bad while sitting down in a car? Torn muscle? Really don’t want to start a job feeling like this!-Im in high school. I wasted my whole school life doing nothing and just wasting air. I decided this year if participate in things more. I have bad public speaking skills. I don't study well. I cheated this whole 2 years of examination. I decided I'll do smt so I participated in an internship for whichs interview I failed( for vice president and other positions) I do think I'll do well if I get a chance and ik I'd be a good leader my slef esteem is just destroyed. Anyway I had a model UN assembly in our school and I wanted to give my name and we had interviews. I messed up so bad I stuttered so much so so much. They teachers even laughed. Ik I failed but I'm so mad I thought I could do smt for once in my life. I feel so worthless I didn't even answer their questions properly. I can't even do my best. It's not like it's my first time giving an interview I did so much better before even. I even dissapointed my friends cause when I'm comfy with them I come off as too rude and aggressive. I ahte being looked down on but all I can think abt is everyone I meet looking down on me. I'm so done with everything.-So, I feel like coffee used to trigger my panic attacks due to the caffeine in it. I've stayed away from caffeine for a whole year and am interested in trying something again, just wondering if anyone has issues with coffee and anxiety?-I feel hopeless. I’ve been suffering from anxiety disorder since college. Last year, I’ve started suffering from a bad health anxiety. I started having panic attacks. Then just recently, I started having this fear of going insane. I started dissociating which makes my anxiety/panic worse. I feel like I’m losing control and that the reality is slipping. Now, health anxiety and dissociation when combined are the worst. I go from thinking I’m going insane to thinking I’m going insane + probably because I have a tumor which I know I don’t because I had a normal brain MRI a year ago. Still, I’m eager to get another brain MRI just to be sure. Also, I’m always light-headed. My head feels empty and also heavy almost all the time. I feel like, I’m only half focused/aware. When I walk I feel like I walk weird and that everything is fuzzy. And when I read, I have to try harder for the sentences to register in my head. I mean I understand them but I forget them right away. It scares me so much that the panic/anxiety is almost constant. Any slight movement can trigger my anxiety. So far, I never had hallucinations. But this combination of extreme fears is making me feel like I’m gonna go insane. It’s so exhausting and depressing. I want to give up on life so bad, I can’t take this anymore. :( can someone please give some advice? I’ll be starting my meds tomorrow. It’s for anxiety and depression. I haven’t told my doctor about dissociation because it’s just recently.-Hey allI have just turned 21 (M). I study at University and I'd say I have a good amount of decent friends. I'm nice guy but I have always struggled with all sorts of relationships. I struggle with anxiety though, and where I am right now,  we are in lockdown for our sixth week. I have been overthinking everything, in particular my social life, dating life, whether I will end up alone and whether I am wasting my youth. It's gotten pretty bad, and I just can't relax. I don't know whether this worrying is useful or not, aka whether this is a genuine worry.  Its keeping me tense, anxious, and unable to relax. I'm thinking of making a doctors appointment and trying medication (I've tried therapy before). I am seeing a psychotherapist currently, but we haven't really discussed this, should I discuss this more with her? What should I do? Am I in the right subreddit? My biggest worry is that I am wasting my youth - I feel I don't have enough friends, that I'm not attractive and that I don't go out enough.So what do I do? I cant keep going along like this?-Hi all, I work as an IT data specialist consultant at a consultancy firm in a western European country. Now currently I am one week into a new assignment where I'm seconded to a company and it is absolutely making me mentally stressed out (even now on the weekend constantly thinking about work, ruminating all the time, not being able to sleep, highly emotional) to the point that it is making me physically ill (headaches, waking up with a knot in my stomach, fatigued etcetera). It is my second assignment after having been seconded about 2 years to another company.Now personally, I think there are a number of factors contributing to this.- First one is probably the biggest and is within myself, in that I'm quite anxious by nature and new job situations are always tricky to me unless I know that the job at hand is one that I can handle 100% with my skills or I can at least get by with a bit of learning. This anxiety is something I'm planning on getting professional help with, but right now that anxiousness is all too prevalent and not helping.- Second is that the (first) project I was put on at this new company requires knowledge of a tool unknown to me. I am the only specialist that is going to work on that part, so I don't really have someone to work with who can guide me. Also this project has a tight deadline that I doubt I can make under these circumstances. I think my seniority in this was overestimated, since it's a whole new game as oppossed to what I did before.- Third is that even with this project going which is already probably hard to complete by the deadline, a flock of people is coming to me to ask me to help on their projects, which is also a lot to handle.Now I'm feeling shit the whole time, even when I'm off of work. I told my manager at my consultancy firm the problems that I was encountering and also the stress and physical symptoms it is causing me to have. He was very understanding and trying to accomodate to make the new place work for me. He also said that they'd stand behind me and that if things didn't work out, they would search something else for me.This made me feel a bit more relaxed for a while, but after that it has been non-stop worrying and feeling bad again for me. Now I'm quite worried that if I go on like this, it will have longer-lasting effects on my health.As I see it now, it's just too much for me given my current mental state. Is it too much to ask from my employer to take me off the assignment and find a more fitting/easier one for me? Given that I've been a good, loyal and hard-working employee before. Never sick, making the clients happy. During this time of an easier assignment I want to go to a psychologist to handle the anxiety I have, to avoid these things in the future.This has become a bit of a rant but I'm just kind of losing it here and am afraid of my mental state right now...-Strangely, I never had anxiety attacks until this past year as a sophomore in college. Ever since my first one I can recall from November of last year, they seem to be getting more frequent and inhibiting over time, and it’s been frustrating trying to pinpoint a possible cognitive/psychological association behind them.Earlier, I almost crashed when my heart rate spiked while driving, and I felt like I was beginning to lose my perception of reality–like I was watching myself die and accepting of the outcome.Few people in my life know about this, and I think it’s time I finally tell my parents in case something worse happens next time.-I been having anxiety and depression problems since my early teens (28 now) and for the past few months felt better than ever with no meds or anything until I injured my eardrum few weeks ago...I can handle pain quite well that was not a problem, not fun either but manageable. The real horror started with vertigo (got an inner ear inflammation because of the eardrum problem that gave me constant dizziness, lightheadedness and nausea) and of course my old friend anxiety kicked in and been having constant anxiety and panic attacks since then.After the ear cleared out i had chest tightness and tingling in left arm, so I freaked out even more and went to A&E, and after blood samples, x rays of heart and lungs everything was in perfect condition so the doctor told me it's my anxiety.I felt better the same day, but then in next few days i started filing tingling in my left cheek, and last night tingling in arm and face got worse, started getting worried and panic attack kicks in wit a headache and shortness of breath and trouble concentrating on whatever people are telling me in that moment so I  make another trip to the A&E with the same result (but without x-ray or mri because doctor was so confident it's just stress and anxiety, as he explaind me if it was something more serious, i would loose muscle feeling so my face would droop, and I wouldn't be able to move my hand). I had million panic attacks and anxiety issues over the years but they've never gave me such physical symptoms that lasted for days and weeks, so whoever is reading this, go and check yourself out definitely - but don't panic, because if you think it's your head it probably is.-nan-Hi all. I don’t normally drink a ton. And tonight I may have had 4 drinks the whole night. That said even then my sleep isn’t that interrupted by it and Id generally go home and pass out and wake up the next day. Right now is very different. And I’m scared. I can’t sleep for more than like 15 minutes at a time. My thoughts are racing so fast they don’t even feel like mine. When I was dreaming my thoughts were also racing so fast it felt like the characters within my dreams were all malfunctioning. Without the auditory hallucination piece it literally feels like I have multiple voices in my head all trying to follow their own train of thought. And I’m ping ponging too and from every thought that comes up. Like I have no control of my thoughts. Is this typical for anxiety? What is this? It feels like I’ve lost some major sense of control, or like I just snapped. Like I’m about to being taken over by other personalities or something. It took some effort even writing this and staying focused.-To get down to it. I unfortunately had “Phone sex” in my case, meaning just texting the other recipient dirty texts and they wanted to send nude photos but I never sent any in return. Which most people do, but if my parents found this out, they would stop talking to me entirely, be extremely disappointed, and my distant family as well would stop talking to me due to beliefs so telling them to get this off my chest is NOT an option AT ALL. I now think that maybe the other person would tell their parents which would tell mine or it would leak out somehow. It’s ruining my whole mood and it’s clear to see. I’m freaking panicking. I want to get a therapist to help.-Every time I posted on social media I feel like I’m being judged by other users. I mean I *crave* to see people’s reactions yet at the same time I’m also so nervous that I cannot stop checking my phone. And every time people are liking my posts- I feel so excited yet at the same time anxious that I cannot stop checking my phone (or even thinking about it). I’m prone to think something may be wrong with my posts if someone’s seen my posts yet they are not liking them.Is there something wrong with the way I see social media? How do I stop feeling this way- how can I be more confident in expressing myself- even online? And by social media I’m referring to something like Instagram- I have no idea why I don’t feel nervous at all when posting on Reddit- probably because nobody here knows me? I tried so hard not to care yet this feeling is not going away.-I tested positive yesterday… I’m double vaxxed, constant mask wearer but I think I caught it at work as I work in education. Tonight has been the worst so far, the combo of waking up wheezing, dizzy, with a temp sent me into an anxiety attack, even harder to regulate my breathing. Ive finally started to calm down, my blue inhaler has helped my asthma and I have music on.I’m not necessarily looking for solutions, maybe just a place for folk to share or vent. I must say I’m quite scared. I’m having flashbacks to the worst things I saw on tv earlier in the pandemic. I don’t want to end up in hospital. I finally stopped crying 15 minutes ago and I’ve barely cried at all since being on sertraline. Anyone got an experience or two to share? Anyone relate to where I am with it? Hope that’s ok to ask! Also apologies for formatting, I’m lying in bed on my phone.-24m. Have had GAD and T as long as I can remember. T was generally mild and never paid attention to it. GAD could occasionally get bad and cause symptoms. But never worsened T. A week ago, I noticed a slightly new T sound. No idea what causes it. Sent me into a full panic questioning everything I did leading up to it, trying to figure out what caused it since I don’t listen to loud music, work in loud areas, or game on loud volume. Recounting every single noise I heard leading up to the morning I first noticed the new flutter pitch. Needless to say, I became hyperparanoid about EVERY sound I heard at home in ways I never have. I hear annoying high pitches from fridge and Xbox fan I didn’t used to hear, but idk if it’s because I’m listening too much now or what. I also think I’m interpreting random tv sounds on broadcast as having an annoying loud high pitched ring. I’m scared to do anything. Unfortunately have to wait 12 more days to see audiologist. In the meantime, I’m afraid it’s only downhill from here. I’m scared to use an electric toothbrush (not sonic), electric razor, drive, do laundry, get a haircut, etc. the hundreds and hundreds of google searches and Reddit searches have only made my feelings worse. Wear ear plugs when driving. Oh wait, another post says not to! (I drive a 2000 sedan. Not the quietest thing in the world but I’m sure it’s better than some louder trucks or utility vans). Am I over sensitive? Is it the anxiety? Will I decline to the point I can’t watch tv or cut my hair? It’s so much to think about!I’m not on medication for anything.-I have a Monday thru Friday job and I recently applied somewhere else for a weekend shift, today I was supposed to start training at 6am, well I got there and was like 12 minutes late I saw allot of cars there and my anxiety started kicking in I just kept driving back and forth deciding if I should go in or not and guess what I didn’t go in I was so nervous and anxious as I was going to be the only one late there for training so I emailed my manager to tell her I was not able to come in due to a family emergency but she has not answered yet and now I’m Nervous all over again contemplating if I should just tell them to withdraw my application because if I do stay I’m going to be the only one doing training next week due to me not going today I literally hate myself for overthinking so much I regret not going in earlier fuck my life-I aren’t on medication or coming off them but my anxiety and stress have been high recently and when i try sleep and occasionally just during the day i will get them. Anyone else?-Conserving I took the pill while my heart rate was 60. Will 10mg drop my rate to 40bpm Or something too low?-nan-Does anyone experience head pressure or has a tension headache?-My asshole father mentioned going to the store and I have to do it my mum has covid so she can’t go I started having a huge meltdown scratching my arm, crying and rocking back and forth. I am so anxious about going to that store but I think what I just experienced isn’t just anxiety. Any help?-Hi all! Me (19F) and my boyfriend (21M) moved in together at new apartment about 2 months ago, and we left my bike sitting on our second story balcony, we figured there was no way that anyone would be able to get it down from there. Well, a couple weeks ago we had a friend over and we were talking pretty loud, and the walls are pretty thin in our complex and my boyfriend suddenly stops and said “did you guys hear that”? We all kind of thought nothing of it because as I said the walls are thin and it honestly wasn’t really anything too out of the ordinary, so we didn’t really bother checking. A couple hours later we walked our friend down to her car and there was a ladder on the side near our balcony which we thought was crazy because we had been talking about that, and we look up and the bike was gone. Ever since I’ve been afraid to be home alone (especially at night) even though I logically know they won’t come back or break in but my anxiety is getting the worst of me. At first it wasn’t too bad because my boyfriend and I worked basically the same schedule, but I since quit that job and am now home a little more often, usually without him and he works closing shifts. Some days are better than others but I’m really starting to get sick of the fear because it’s almost unbearable and quite frankly just annoying. And I just feel so stupid that I’m an adult who’s afraid to be home alone. I’ve been thinking about getting a dog but other than that I’m kind of out of ideas. Does anyone have any tips on how to deal with or get rid of the fear and paranoia?-nan-i’m in junior year now and i went back to school yesterday. luckily i only had to go for one day and now it’s the weekend but i seriously don’t know how i’ll survive the whole year. i feel like i just can’t do it.every single little thing is stressing me out so much, the presentations i’ll have to do, teacher asking me questions, the people there, eating in front of everyone, stomach rumbling in class, the clothes i wear, worrying about smelling bad, or if i didn’t brush my teeth correctly, or if something gets stuck in my braces, or my hair getting greasy after 12 hours of washing it, or forgetting my stuff etc. and as if it wasn’t enough i live about an hour away from my school, and with traffic it’s like an hour and a half to get there in the morning, and like two hours to get back home. i feel like i’m just wasting my time when i could be planning what to do the day after. i don’t know how to manage all this stress. i had medication but finished it and my mom refuses to buy me more because she thinks i don’t need it anymore and i’m doing better. it’s been like 5 months something. i don’t know what to do about it-I’m a groomsman in a wedding today and I’m anxious. I’ve been in a handful of weddings in the past (including my own), and each one I literally had a panic attack standing up in the front of everyone during the ceremony in the church. I always stuck it out but inside I was panicking, heart racing to 160, sweating, etc. I have this fear of being in a spot where I know there is no escape at the moment, and if I try to, everyone in the room will stare at me. I need some advice! I am considering drinking a little before the ceremony, or taking a Xanax (obviously one or the other, not both together).-Is it okay to take 1mg benzo whenever I am about to enter an anxiety inducing situation like exams , social events etc ? Or is this is a bad idea.-My whole family is on the zoom chat and they’re so loud and it’s driving me crazy. I’m already feeling really anxious and they’re all so loud and screaming talking over the camera. I feel even worse now, my legs are shaking and I’m trying to breathe through it- my stomach is also turning. How do I stop this… does anyone else feel loud noises are a trigger sometimes or make it worse ?-Trigger warning.. death.. I know I titled this thanatophobia. But I don’t think I have the phobia. It’s just something that scares me. Just like every other person. But I just need to vent a little..I am absolutely terrified of dying. Not the act of dying. But just of being dead. Once you die you’re just nothing, for the rest of eternity, it’s just blackness. And that part there just absolutely terrifies me. I don’t ever want to die. Yeah, I know, you won’t even know you’re dead. But the fact is, I won’t be living this life anymore. I won’t ever live another life again. I won’t be enjoying hanging out with family, or my pets anymore. Or enjoying the sunset. Or the new cool games/movies they’ve got coming out every year. I will sit up crying for an hour because I can’t stop myself from thinking of this stuff. Thankfully this fear doesn’t stop me from living my life, but it does absolutely scare me and raises my anxiety through the roof when I actually let myself sit and think about it. I’ve even had panic attacks because of it. Life just isn’t fair.-Hi everyone. I was prescribed hydroxyzine(50mg) and Zoloft 25mg to help treat my anxiety. I have crippling health anxiety so I’m really scared to start this. I’m thinking of starting off with the hydroxyzine to help me sleep… but I’m seeing people say it made them dizzy…. As someone who struggles with off balance/dizziness(don’t know the exact cause,but doctors say it might be stress related) I’m kinda scared it’ll make it worse. Anyone who is or has taken hydroxyzine- has this made you dizzy? Any other side effects?-Has anyone experienced strange smells and cold feet that start panic attacks? I know it sounds ridiculous but I’ve had a strange scent that comes and goes and sends me into a frenzy as I’m sure there’s nothing there and it’s as if my senses are heightened x 100I also get extremely cold feet despite being in sweats / having socks on-TW: mention of self harmHad a stressful situation today and couldn't remember any positive coping skills in the moment--all I could think of was inflicting physical pain. Managed to get home and hold off and talk with my husband instead, but it wasn't until much later this evening when I realized I could have at least tried some deep breathing and yoga to help stop feeling so fight-or-flight-y and then be able to concentrate on work. How do you remind yourself to breathe in those moments?-It’s like i can’t breathe normally i’m always worried bout my heart and worry something gonna happen, but a part of me tries to be optimistic. I’m currently on Lexapro (3rd day), and don’t know how i feel about it. I just want help i feel like i’m fighting for my life everyday everysecond but i wanna live i wanna get through-I have the most amazing and incredible boyfriend [18M] in the entire world. We have been together for 15 months now and I love him with everything inside me. I have never felt this much love for someone in my life. The longer that we have been together, the more I’ve realized how much I want to spend time with him. If we could hang out every day, I would honestly be the happiest person. When we aren’t together, I have this crippling separation anxiety. I’m okay for about 24 hours without seeing him  before I develop the physical symptoms of anxiety, resulting in nightly crying sessions and a stomach that’s tied up in knots. I didn’t realize how insecure of a person I am until i realized how head over heels I love I am. He said no to hanging out today so he could have a family night and I immediately started blaming myself thinking that maybe something I said earlier has made him not want to see me. I’m so afraid that if I’m overly affectionate or overly romantic that he’s going to stiff arm me (even though that’s something he’s never done before). So I’ve caught myself pulling away from him and that is the last thing I want to do. Does anyone have any advice for me? How can I cope with this anxiety?-I posted a day or two ago about a doctors appointment that I’ve made for tomorrow, which will be my first in yeaaars. Does anyone have any advice for how to prepare anxiety wise? I already feel quite nervous, and I don’t want to be shaking and freaking out the whole time I’m there. How do you prepare for appointments like this?-Hi everyone. I’m a 27F who’s had a terrible time since April of this year and I feel defeated. I need guidance. I need true reassurance because I can’t believe all my symptoms are anxiety related.In April of this year I had a minor surgery to drain a cyst - totally unrelated (or maybe not?) during recovery I started to feel my first symptoms: tingling legs with restless legs. I’d never felt this in my life so I went to the ER, thought my antibiotics weren’t sitting well with me. I had my heart checked and blood word - was told it’s anxiety. About a week later I was grocery shopping, felt a sharp pain in my left arm that travelled to my chest and it was painful to breathe. I drove home in a panic, had my first ever panic attack once I got inside. Everything was numb and tingling, my face, body, my hands were curled up, my lips curled up, I couldn’t breathe, we didn’t know what was happening so my boyfriend rushed me back to the ER. Checked my heart again and was told it was a panic attack. A week after that my chest had a constant burning pain for a couple days, went back to ER and was told my chest wall was inflamed - prescribed naproxen for 10 days. The tingling in body continued on and off during this time and after. I felt better in the sun in the summer. Beach days were my favourite, I felt happy and my symptoms subsided. Symptoms would come and go throughout summer though. I started getting really cold - freezing. Doctor requested blood work. Everything was normal but my B12 level on a scale of 138-620 pmol/L was 192pmol/L and iron on a scale of 5-250 was at 30. I had been googling my symptoms during this entire time, scared to death I have MS. Palpitations, leg twitching, heaviness in legs and pins and needles in feet when driving. Last week I had an appointment with my GP for a full neurological exam. I passed everything. My doctor said because I had an MRI in February of this year and it came back clear (along with me passing the neurological exam) MS was highly unlikely. I brought up my B12 and Iron levels being low and my lifelong stomach issues maybe not absorbing these vitamins being the cause of my neurological symptoms and my doctor told me not to worry about those because they’re still within range. She then told me it’s anxiety and she’d like to put me on medication and therapy. I feel defeated because I don’t know how anxiety can cause these symptoms. I was diagnosed with situational anxiety as a teenager but that was just heart palpitations and nausea - nothing like this. It’s like my mind won’t accept anxiety for an answer and I’m almost praying it’s the low vitamin levels and nothing more serious. I feel helpless, I want to feel normal again, not worry about my future and present symptoms. Has anyone else had a similar situation or even a similar B12 situation? Anything helps.Thank you so much for reading-Hi, I have been suffering from moderate social anxiety since I am a teenager. I decided to give CBT a try. I want to ask for advice on how to start.CBT consist of different practices (relaxation techniques, working with thoughts, exposure therapy, self-compassion, etc..), and I wish I had time to explore it all, but I don't have it. Based on your experience, If you can recommend me doing only one thing, what would it be and why?Thank you in advance 💚-I always wondered how people could go through with committing suicide, I never understood the feeling of not wanting to feel something anymore so much to the point where you would take your own life. I have been dealing with anxiety for the past 2 and a half years and it just keeps getting worse. Im 18 and i have no health insurance i just applied for medicaid hopefully i get approved so I can get help. I do not want to go out like that it, urks me on the inside thinking that it is the only way out when I my real self knows it isnt. ive been strong my whole life through whatever i always told myself gods got you youll make it through the storm and i always have but anxiety puts up such a fight. my mental health is deteriorating im losing hope but i know deep down that this can change but i dont know if its enough to keep me going. this shit is horrible.-I’ve posted here like 10 times. Thank you to all who have taken the time out of their lives to respond.  No, I haven’t taken the medication yet. I wish I Did. Just don’t have the courage. Okay I’m gonna make this as short as I can. I used to take Xanax(as prescribed) but it’s been a couple years and I’ve been living in an anxiety induced hell for 2 years. I legitimately don’t even know what normal feels like anymore. All I know is what I feel now isn’t. I’m a stranger in my own body and head. I have all the physical and mental symptoms of anxiety you can imagine. I kept thinking “I woke up like this one day maybe I’ll wake up normal”. But I didn’t. I’ve always had your more normal anxiety. But this, this is some next level shit I can’t escape and haven’t for 2 years. I’m not even able to be a father to my nearly 2 year old. I don’t leave my house and when I do it’s a mental battle and I feel like the world is caving in.  Long story short I said, my bad. I got put on Xanax again to get me out of this rut. Once I’m able to function I’m getting on something more long term. I’ve let this eat me alive. I can’t escape this hole alone. What can I expect when taking the Xanax? I really don’t want to freak the fuck out and have worse anxiety. I’m trapped in this cycle because my anxiety is so bad I’ve convinced myself that medicine will make it worse so I don’t take it and just suffer.  But what can I expect while taking it? Initial onset? I hate any type of “high” and i especially don’t want to be “high” and anxious. I basically just want to know if this will give me relief without freaking out. Sorry for the language if it offended anybody. I’m just at the end of my rope and want to be normal again and be A father.-So I have OCD that is linked to feeling guilty if, for example, I had a compliment from someone about something, I’d have to think to myself ‘well others have whatever they complimented too and a lot have it a lot bettenicer than me’. I also feel guilty as I have some good friends, travelled, although I have had my fair share of negative things to balance it out, eg: a rocky family life and don’t have much money so currently still live in my family home in my late 20s, which has resulted in a lot of difficult times over the years, have some health problems and never experienced romantic love despite being in an almost 3-year relationship. Ive also experienced difficulties including bullying amongst other various things. I just can’t shake this guilty feeling which might have stemmed from having a brother who has never worked and my parents giving him stuff and letting him get away with all sorts as ‘he’s missed out’. As a result, I’ve put up with a lot of bad treatment over the years. However, I overall enjoy where I live, I have a job in the sector I want to work however I’m just currently in an admin role and not making much money. (I have to justify having this by repeating to myself that it’s ‘just admin’ and ‘not that well paid’). Basically, just that others have a lot more than me. I also feel a bit anxious as I have ended up in a sector which I wanted to work in, which again isn’t a big deal as obviously I’ve made decisions and choices to work in this sector based on what I chose to do at university etc., and this is the same for anyone with a goal of being a vet, doctor etc. I just want someone to tell me I’m being ridiculous, I don’t have that much and shouldn’t feel guilty? I’d really appreciate the advice, thank you.-I experience internal tremors first in neck,eyes and feel a pressure in my head then Tremor moves to hand and feet and when trying to concentrate feel like I will faint and pass out. I had a CT scan and a spine x-ray all normal. It's really scary, my doctor says it's anxiety but I'm finding it hard to believe-I have struggled with panic anxiety disorder and ptsd for a while now. In 2013 I got a really bad panic anxiety attack and thought something was wrong with my heart. That year there were a lot of visits to the emergency room, hospitals and my doctor. They suspected something could be wrong with my heart, and had to have a 24h EKG a couple of times, and they did an ultrasound of my heart. Nothing turned up, and my heart was healthy. No one thought to suggest that it could be anxiety, so I went on with my life and it stopped for a while. Turns out I had a lot of minor anxiety attacks after this, and then it got really bad again in December last year. This was hands down my worst panic anxiety attack ever.&#x200B;Since then I went to a see a therapist. We found out that a lot of my anxiety attacks were because how my then stepmom treated me. She was verbally abusive all the time, and in some cases she was even physically abusive. This is were my PTSD stems from. I would for example get anxiety attacks if someone opened the door too fast (like she did, because that sound meant she was coming to scream at me). For a while I thought the root of my anxiety was her, cause I get really stressed if I think I'm doing something the wrong way etc. So I knew the PTSD and the fear of doing something the incorrect way was because of her, but I still felt something was missing. It didn't explain all of my anxiety.&#x200B;Recently I discovered that the root of my anxiety is my dad. That was when everything clicked in place. My mom said I have always been an anxious kid. The most annoying thing was that I always had to go to the bathroom no matter where we were and what we were doing (when my stresslevel is really high, I have to go to the bathroom really bad and often). My dad always put work before anything else. So from when I was around 4 years old, my dad would go to work before I usually woke up and come home late at night when I was asleep. If I wanted to see him, I had to wake up without an alarm clock or without my dad waking me up. I remember I always woke up in a panic and was really afraid that he was gone and would get out of my bed as fast as I could, run down the stairs and look out the window to see if his car was gone. If the car was gone, I would just cry hysterically for a really long time, and there was little my mom could do to calm me down. He was usually home on sundays but he didn't really spend much time with me.When I was 6 up to 7 or 8 years old, before my parents slipt up, he would sometimes drive me to school and my siblings to kindergarden. I remember I just wanted to talk to him when he did this, but he was always on the phone the whole time and told us not to interrupt. I would often get so mad that I just walked away from him and walked to school myself. It took him a while to notice I was gone. If I didn't walk away, he would usually forget to drop me off at school (I was the last kid he would drop off), so he just drove right past it while on his phone. Then he would get mad at me for not reminding him that I was still in the car.&#x200B;When I was around 8 years old, my parents had split up and he was living by himself. We would spend time at his place every other weekend and every thursday. But those days were often cancelled because he had to work or just wanted to go out partying instead of spending time with us. When we were there, he was usually talking on his phone due to work, so we wouldn't really get to spend time with him. I would often get so mad that I ran away, and would often find a spot where I could see the road to see how long it would take before he noticed I was gone and went out looking for me. It usually took around an hour or two.  Sometimes my dad would take us places, but it was usually because he was doing activities with his friends (often paintball), and we just had to sit and watch them play for a couple of hours, and then he was back on his phone.&#x200B;When I was 9, he got together with my then stepmom and quickly moved in with her and her two kids. Her kids always ruined our things, ran after us with swords or knives and just generally hurting us (her son for example broke my sister's arm and knocked out a tooth). Our then stepmom started to verbally abuse us pretty quickly and I told this to my dad several times. He refused to listen and just told me that I was exaggerating or that I just misunderstood the whole situation. I remember my mom eventually set up a meeting where my dad had to show up so that I could voice my concerns. He got really angry, said that he refused to listen to it and just stormed off. After this my dad told me I had to apologize to my then stepmom and needed to be nice to her. I had to live with them until I was 18 when I moved away. From I was 9 to 18 I tried several times to tell my dad how my then stepmom was but I was shut down as quickly as all the other times I did. In this time period I also tried to tell my grandmom (my father's mom) what was going on, but she too refused to listen. When I told my friends about the situation, or my boyfriends, they all said I was exaggerating and refused to believe me.  In my teenage years I got pretty wild, and could pretty much do whatever I wanted without my dad questioning me why I was out all night or what I was doing. I could come home drunk and he wouldn't do much about it. I realize now that this was pretty much a cry for help and trying to get him to notice me.  My then stepmom would also be verbally abusive right in front of him, and he would just ignore the situation and didn't do anything about it.  I moved out when I was 18, but my then stepmom and my dad was my boss, so from 18 to 20 years old, I had to deal with her while I was on work (I needed the money).&#x200B;So I realize now where my insecurities come from and why I have anxiety and why I had the need to be noticed or acknowledged. Now I get a panick attack every time my stresslevel goes up and I can get a panick attack from pretty much anything, not just specific things.   From 20 years old to now, 28 years old, he hasn't been good at reaching out, asking me how I'm doing and stuff like that. I rarely see him and I rarely speak with him. I realized all this for just a couple of days ago. I have now decided to cut him out of my life, based on something that happened this week. Last week he said he was coming to my town for a job meeting, and he made plans to go out to eat with me while he was in town. Two days before he was supposed to come to my town, I saw on snapchat that he and his family (his new girlfriend and their two kids) was traveling here. I didn't hear anything from him the first day they were in town, and I didn't hear anything from him the second day either. And then I saw on snapchat that they have gone home. I didn't hear a word from him. We had plan for the next day and I knew then that our plans would not happen (as usual. He often comes to my town for job meetings but never think to let me know, and the few times he does, he cancels on me). Then the day came, and I heard nothing. Today I got a message from him where he straight up lied to me, explaining that he hadn't traveled to my town and that the travel was cancelled because of the storm (the storm came in the afternoon the day we had plans, not the two whole days while he actually were in my town).&#x200B;I honestly feel really angry and disappointed at this moment. I've decided to cut him out of my life cause this is too toxic for me, and he doesn't respect me. I've also discovered that he has been talking trash about my fiancé, whom he has met briefly a few times. I've realized that after 28 years I'm just done trying to get my dad's attention and affection. I'm just done. And I realize that this means that I will probably lose contact with my grandmother, because she thinks my dad can do no wrong and refuses to listen if we tell her something she doesn't want to hear about him. This whole situation has driven my anxiety to go haywire.   Sorry for the long post. I just had to get it out.  Has anyone else been in a similar situation? I would love to hear it, or just general advice cause at the moment I feel like I'm being a huge asshole for doing this. Thanks.-Hi everyone, I’ll start off by saying that my sleep schedule is absolute shit at the moment. I feel like I use my phone in bed so much because I feel like I’ll starve off the anxiety so I’m sleeping around 3am and these incidents make it so hard to stay asleep. What I’m experiencing is weird , you know that gorgeous feeling just as you’re falling asleep, I’ve been feeling like zapped out of it. Sometimes I feel like I can’t breathe and my heart starts pounding, other times it feels like a switch in my brain saying “nope wake up”. It’s hard to explain. It’s incredibly annoying and strange - the most bizarre thing was yesterday, it literally felt like someone hit me in the head. I always worry that this means I won’t be able to sleep again but I always fall asleep in the end. Is anyone familiar with this? Maybe it’s the mixture of anxiety and sleep deprivation?-I deal with anxiety on a daily basis. Its nothing new for me, sometimes its easier to cope with sometimes i can't eat much because of it. Tonight i start my new job and holy smokes am I anxious! I'm worried but excited. Worried because i haven't worked in this environment before and maybe ill make mistakes, excited because its a new start for me and i know working will benefit me a great deal! Sometimes the bravest thing we can do as people who suffer with anxiety is face our fears head on and come through it with a new sense of confidence! Lets show anxiety cannot hold us in its grasp, face it, conquer it, own it! Have a lovely weekend guys. I hope I do well in my new job. I hope you reading this can face one of your fears today!-I’m not too sure anyone will see this, even if no one does, I just need to get this out of my brain. My family has known for about a year my mom has stage 4 colon cancer. 2 days ago she took a big step by having a surgery to have the tumor removed. But they also noticed it’s spread more into her liver than before. And a week prior they had found nodules on her lungs as well. The doctors are trying to decide on if they should put her back on chemo (one of her doctors thinks they should and the other disagrees saying it would be too much for her body to handle). Or just let it ride it’s course and give her the best life we can with whatever time she has left. My sister has been a huge help in taking care of my mom and being at the doctors with her because I work 2 jobs and she lives at the house with them. I’ve called out of work before so I can be there, but then work gets upset if I’m gone too much. And then I feel guilty for my sister having to do so much and I feel like I know nothing on the situation because I don’t have the chance to be there. But then I feel bad not being at work or work gets upset I’m not there. Trying to be with my family, work 2 jobs, and try and just maintain some sense of balance is getting to be so hard. I have no motivation for anything left in me. I want to be helpful to everyone, but I also just want to be alone so badly. I’m not sure what the point of this was. I just know I needed to get these words out, but I have no close friends to talk to. So I’m sorry to anyone who had to read this. But if you did read it, I truly thank you and I hope you had a good day today.-Ever since I started my second year of college my anxiety has gotten to a level where it's rly negatively affecting my life. I'm always nervous, always getting chest pains, always acting weird and scared, I've gone on meds, my friends convinced me to start therapy, I've had 3 anxiety attacks in the past week. And it's pretty much all because of my college major. I'm a CS major and for some reason I rly hate it and it makes me nervous as shit. I've tried to suck it up and get through it, but I just don't know how much longer I can handle it. I wish I was normal and could just fucking do stuff without panicking. But for some reason I'm not normal and I just can't. In this sorta situation, would it be reasonable if I took a semester off college to focus on my mental health and revaluate everything. I feel like I should stay in the CS program because it's secure and safe, and I should just be in school in general. But it's making me feel awful. So I dunno what to do.-I feel tension inside my body and I get spasms all over it. Don't know what to do to relax.-Will everything be okay? I feel so lost with my life. I feel like a failure. I feel like I’m running out of time-So I’m doing pretty well these days. I kicked depressions ass, and anxiety isn’t destroying me like it used to. I’ve gone through exposure therapy and it’s done wonders. One last step though. My therapist told me to get on a dating app and meet up with women. (Because they’re kind of the ultimate thing that stresses me.) I get along fine with girls and I know some find me attractive, it’s just, until now shyness made dating impossible. Add My fear of intimacy in the mix of and here I am a 23 year old virgin.But let’s forget about sex, for now. I should focus on dating and having a good time. The rest will come. But this is terrifying. So I guess I’m asking you for tips ? I’m not asking for dating advice, but how to I find the courage to do this ? Peace !-thank u everyone in this subreddit for all of ur good advice and empathy. it’s nice to read that other people go through the same things as i do <3-I have an Apple Watch and it’s been giving me more and more Low Heart Rate notifications in the past month. I’m not athletic at all.They started to increase these last days and my heart went as low as 40bpm during sleep. Which is a record breaker for me. It used to stay between 45-50As of writing this it’s registering 59bpmShould I worry? I’m extremely afraid that I’m gonna have a cardiac arrest during my sleep.I also started taking zoloft (25mg for now) 4 days ago but idk if it’s affecting it or not.Anybody had similar experiences? Any suggestions?-I already took my anxiety med I'm waiting for it to kick in.I feel like crying. It isn't an \"end of the world\" diagnosis but after recently suffering a saddle pulmonary embolism I just cannot take another health problem right now. I'm only in my 20s I shouldn't be dealing with this.Please any support or hugs would really help-Wish I could just walk straight. Say yes or no. Make a decision and stick to it. I feel so cold. I don’t talk to people. I just go to work and drone on like I’m not even there. There’s so much going on in my head and I just don’t understand right now. I resent everyone yet I long for connection. Wondering when the good news comes that this life is all just a joke or something because it doesn’t feel real anymore-Hi, I had a panic attack a month ago and since then almost every time I yawn it seems to almost trigger a new panic attack . Very weird to explain but I can’t complete my yawn it’s like I can’t breath properly after it. Someone had that before? If so how did you get rid of it?-I cheated on an exam today. It was 25 questions and I answered it in 10 minutes. Im scared the computer will detect that I cheated and I’ll get caught. My friend helped me and maybe the computer caught that she was going through her answers at the same time. I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it. I’m in college and they take this stuff seriously. I’m so scared I’ll be dropped from this semester. I’ve seen a therapist who suspects I have GAD. It’s been hours and there’s been a pit in my stomach. I can’t stop shaking and crying while I think about it. I know I get anxious over a lot but it’s never been like this. I wanna rip my brain out of my head. I’m so scared right now. What if I ruin my life and my friends?? What will my family think? How can I even calm myself down. I don’t think I can sleep. I regret cheating. I feel like I’m about throw up.- I can't stop overthinking and analysing things I've done in the past, I can't stop worrying what other people think or tell about me. How to deal with it?-Sometimes I feel alright and like I’m living with my anxiety pretty well, but then a lot of the time I just feel awful. I feel bad bringing this up to people in my life because I feel like I’m bothering them and have nothing to complain about since I live a pretty privileged life and stuff. I’m just tired of feeling so overwhelmed and exhausted by every little thing I worry about so much of the time.-I’m a full time college student and got diagnosed with RSV after being out of school for a week but I can’t rest /relax because I keep thinking about all the assignments I missed ,stuff I’ll have to catch up on,and exams I’ll have to retake when I get back. I also left my instrument in the locker when I was there last and haven’t been able to retrieve it so I missed out on a weeks worth of practice time. I was already struggling before I got sick, and now it’s worse. I constantly get sick and it was like this all through jr high and high school and it took a huge toll on my mental health and now it’s happening again. My anxiety has always been bad, but it’s heightened in these kind of situations. Idk how to deal with it all.-Has anybody here actually tried using it!??-Edit: OK GUYS IM GOING TO STOP COMPLAINING AND IM GOING TO GET ALL THE WEEK'S WORK DONE NOW AND IM GOING To STUDY FOR MY EXAMS WOOOO UH im going to post on this sub again next week and be like, i got my grades up. I've ALWAYS been an A student, my entire life. Now im a senior in HS. So I started taking classes at community college in the mornings, I take three classes there per semester, psychology, public speaking, and personal finance. God they are so hard I have B's in two of them and a C in one and its stressing me out so much when my parents find out theyre going to go insane and im so worriedI also work as a freelancer so i have to write around 10k words in research writing/marketing a week, and i ALSO have highschool full time, and ALSO i got hired at the grocery store and im going to be working 16 hours a week starting next week and I love that im doing all this cause i need money but it is absolutely at the expense of my grades and im caring more about making money than good grades now. Honestly, i dont care about school at all anymore. Which is a feeling ive never felt because ive always been so worried about it. Now i cant bring myself to try cause it seems useless anyways. grades are dumb, but then seeing that i have bad grades is worrying me so much and idk what to doI think im going to use it as a motivator to try realy hard on my next few assignments and bump up my grades for all those classes, but still, im really stressed out about it and i had to rant lol\n"
