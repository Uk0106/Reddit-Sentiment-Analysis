"I’m on the fence about whether or not these can be classified as panic attacks, as they don’t seem as severe as other people on here are describing (I have no chest pain, hyperventilation, feeling like I’m dying, the works)."

"I also feel guilty as I have some good friends, travelled, although I have had my fair share of negative things to balance it out, eg: a rocky family life and don’t have much money so currently still live in my family home in my late 20s, which has resulted in a lot of difficult times over the years, have some health problems and never experienced romantic love despite being in an almost 3-year relationship."
"Over the past few weeks, I’ve felt my self slipping and had the occasional bad day here in there."
"Everything was numb and tingling, my face, body, my hands were curled up, my lips curled up, I couldn’t breathe, we didn’t know what was happening so my boyfriend rushed me back to the ER."
"I want to give up on life so bad, I can’t take this anymore."
I was on lexapro for a while but it didn’t rly help me.
It's eating me up.
I’ve also become sensitive to low-moderate level safe decibel noise in a way I never have been.
"And if so, should I tell my dentist beforehand that I took something?"
I wish I was normal and could just fucking do stuff without panicking.
and i’ve tried to be that guy who starts conversation when it gets awkward but it seems no one else wants to put in the effort to hold a goddamn conversation.
It... was a lot.
Oh god the meat /was/ off.
Chronic sore ear pain or stuffy ears 24/7.
"Also, my trigger is usually thinking that I'll die."
I’m starting a shitty call center job that’s remote from home In 2 weeks that’s basically an entry level job for 22 year olds so why I went to college and got a bachelors I have no Fkn idea since I’ve done nothing with it and still have all my student loans to pay back.
class plus I have a five year old.
"But I’d do it in most cases.Lately, I’m not sure if it’s increased social anxiety due to not seeing my friends in person for so long or if I’m just more hyper aware of the lengths it takes me to get to places, but I’ve turned into a flanker."
Yesterday was my first day working there and it was extremely chaotic because there was an audit happening.
I should focus on dating and having a good time.
I always viewed anxiety as being stupid.
I did some research and read an article on having a healthy gut.
"I was with the same group, and was getting completely ignored."
I can't walk for longer than five minutes without the dizziness just completely throwing me off and I'm just irritable 24/7.
"it’s like these alarms in my head start blaring because i know i’m going to have to endure conversation i’m not a part of nor do i know about, inside jokes/references i won’t get and will have to awkwardly listen, etc… now im a very good conversationalist and i am in no way bad at being in a group, but i just hate being there."
My weight is low as well.
I need to make more decisions and act without overthinking things.
Which probably makes my head feel a little funny during the day.
"As in anxiety fluctuating without a reason as to why.-I’ve been having increased anxiety the last few weeks, talked with my primary care dr, therapist and psychiatrist to get things sorted."
"But the fact is, I won’t be living this life anymore."
"I usually just force myself to swallow now because if I don’t eat I’d be worse off but idk why this is happening and why it’s been happening for so long nowNot to mention how my stomach hurts every time I eat and my pooping habits seem to have changed, almost like I’m stopped up-I was just wondering how people ""turn it off"" effectively, and if there is such a thing, and how to do it."
I’ve been recommended Zoloft but I am TERRIFIED of gaining weight.
"I just get over-stimulated, which zaps my energy and can trigger my anxiety because I start having thoughts along the lines of, am I going to be able to get out of this situation before I crash/etc."
It’s for anxiety and depression.
"I would often get so mad that I ran away, and would often find a spot where I could see the road to see how long it would take before he noticed I was gone and went out looking for me."
", which led me to a sort of temporary derealization of about (3-4 days)    From that experience something had changed in me, I felt very often pressure in the chest, blurred vision, dizziness that I did not immediately relate to anxiety but probably to my low blood pressure, but I was wrong."
"I would give myself a time limit and most of the time, my extroverted self would come out."
Not fun.
"Someday I hope that I can be free from this demon, learn to control it from interfering from my life, I am already receiving group therapy treatment from a Mental Health Counselor, hope it helps.-Today has not been off to a good start for me."
I'm thinking of making a doctors appointment and trying medication (I've tried therapy before).
"Well fast forward to me tapering of in spring 2020, I was officially done with the med august 2020… then covid got worse and my boyfriend got sick."
"!-This is a bit complicated to explain, but here's an example: let's say i'm in love with this guy and he gets a girlfriend."
"But tonight I’ve had a full blown, manic, breathless panic attack and I’m not sure where to go from here."
I haven’t slept the whole night for the past month due to back pain & soaking my pajamas in the night and realllly miss sleeping the whole night.
Most of the time it’s the throat collapse feeling accompanied by really bad panic.
What should I do?
One last step though.
"Feeling like this kills my productivity, too, because I just can't get myself to focus on other stuff in the meantime.-hi guys!"
I feel like I am being dramatic af and trying to pity myself.
it was awesome because guess what?
He says my feelings don’t make sense and I continuously say that he can’t understand how I’m feeling but please have some empathy and  don’t get mad at me.
"I’ve never gotten really sick from food (knock on wood), but the idea haunts me."
"I discovered my situation very recently, after a period in which an ever increasing amounts of bad thoughts started crossing my mind."
My mom was in the other room and started laughing as i began to cry and yell at my dad to stop.
Never saw one.
It’s currently 1:53am and I have to get up at 7am to take my step children to school but I can’t sleep.
I see many people working all day every day and I ask myself wether I'll be able to handle it.
I feel like I’m being controlled by anxiety and I’m not my true self.
The constant worrisome pain.
But I didn’t.
😥😥😥-Ugh I’ve struggled for so long with the same subject.
I used to take Xanax(as prescribed) but it’s been a couple years and I’ve been living in an anxiety induced hell for 2 years.
Anxiety is a real bitch.
i just want it to be easy.
"I was such a fool, blinded and forgiving over and over again."
Which is a record breaker for me.
"i can barely sleep into 6am, i’m constantly overthinking, my heart rate is extremely fast and my nicotine dependency is coming back."
"I don’t want be such a rude person but I feel like I freeze up when I‘m trying to respond to a text....-(This is also a bit of a vent, but I think it helps paint the picture of my problems)Backstory as to why I have this problem in the first place."
"I’ve gotten 4 ECGs, 2 chest X-rays, blood work, ultrasound of heart and I was cleared except for a sinus arythmia that could’ve been caused by dehydration, stress, or cardiac problems so I never know to be worried or not."
"i have lots of other problems like agoraphobia, emetophobia, depression and panic attack."
We worry about worrying.The root cause of anxiety is the fear of losing control.
Did it end up being okay?
I assume it was because of “covid” and she was keeping distance but my things were already bagged and there was room on the conveyor belt for her to set her items down.
I’ve cut back on caffeine.
I now think that maybe the other person would tell their parents which would tell mine or it would leak out somehow.
"Like, if I don’t hit a certain quota by the end of the day, I feel bad."
It's intermittent and gets worse as the anxiety gets worse.
My head feels so light and I feel out of touch-I had a very vivid hallucination I think last night.
"After all this I don't know what to do now, my mother is very religious and believes this is all black magic and Satan's doing."
"Anyone else felt like that before?I just want to pause and cry it all out, but I can't since I'm in school.-I’m going to go have my blood pressure checked just to see if everything is good."
It teaches your brain that there is no danger!
"Also, with the therapy thing, I did talk to my uncle who is a professional therapist in the states but I didn't talk to him too much because he was family and I didn't talk with him too frequently."
"now don’t get me wrong, yes they were bad friends and most friend groups won’t ignore people they bring to hang out, but there my friend is where you are wrong."
"So, we create stories in our minds to feel a sense of control over our lives."
"I went to the ER, and they did an x-ray, EKG, blood test, etc., but they didn't find any problems and said it's likely due to my panic/anxiety disorders.The thing is though, this is pretty new to me."
It was really overwhelming.
Anyways that’s my rant and my advice.
And I’m having to start my classes online.
"I had a panic attack once when I cooked chicken tenders for myself because I thought it was undercooked/spoiled, even thought the meat was fine and I checked the internal temperature like 5 times."
I am embarrased by the amount of time off I’ve had to have recently.
I keep pushing away my fiancé and all my fears and insecurities are eating away at me.
"Thanks-So in Victoria , Australia, we’re still in lock down and have been 200 days now.My biggest anxiety isn’t getting COVID, but it’s realising that when everything opens up again that I’ll probably still be at home on the weekends and everyone else will be out and about with their other group of friends It’s very daunting to me and as much as I hate not being able to go out , I also feel safe knowing that EVERYONE is at home not doing anything and I’m not suffering from major FMOPlease tell me if anyone else feels or felt this way?-I was accepted to an internship and I start tomorrow."
I did get prescribed a  small dose (like 2 or 3 pills) of anxiety meds.
Anxiety is regulated in the amygdala.
When I’ve done that in the past in relationships it’s never been a good time and I have PTSD from relationships.
🥺-so i was working an airshow for my Navy cadet thing and i had a rlly bad panic attack.
"I think my seniority in this was overestimated, since it's a whole new game as oppossed to what I did before.- Third is that even with this project going which is already probably hard to complete by the deadline, a flock of people is coming to me to ask me to help on their projects, which is also a lot to handle.Now I'm feeling shit the whole time, even when I'm off of work."
I also have a darker spots on my stool but I take Iron supplements so I associate it with that and I also get externe cramps and my life side below my rips it hurts so bad when I touch it.
How can I make this transition less stressful and get my life back on track and how will I know if this difficult period is temporary or not?-You hear about all these motivational speakers saying turn off your emotions that seems to be a lot easier said than done.
"I just feel discouraged-Hiii everyone, i’ve been struggling with an intense fear of falling asleep."
I did not experienced anxiety at all and was almost believing that I won my fight.
I feel sad we didn’t get the house now.
"I don't really mind that because it's for the best, but the problem is, i know the biggest reason for my anxiety and nobody else does... And that is, i was being bullied in middle school (I'm in highschool rn)."
"It doesn't matter what I'm thinking about, if I'm not fully focused, this pressure makes itself known."
Meat and eggs have salmonella.
I've kind of realized most of my anxiety is physical related.
I felt my heart rate beating during this like it normally would during anxiety.
What should I do I’m always scared that I have something or a health issues every time I feel something I freak out and I start googling stuff to see if what I’m feeling is normal.
"He got really angry, said that he refused to listen to it and just stormed off."
And I had the worst anxiety i’ve had in years.
It’s hard to say if i am seeing flashes or not or it’s just my anxiety.
"i’ve applied to and interviewed for every job that makes sense for my previous sales skill, though i don’t want to stay in sales."
"I’ve been doing so well I have actually, since Thursday, graduated from outpatient and am now seeing a regulars therapist once a week."
I felt so humiliated.
So August I got my period TWICE which was the first week on of the month and it still felt light but then 3 and half weeks later I got my period again on the last 7 days of august and this time it was heavy which I felt relieved.
The whole thing lasted two months.
"I follow my daily routine of having a shower, do my hair, makeup - everything seems just fine."
"At some point, I was talking to a shaman, yes a literal shaman, and I was describing my anxiety to him, and he asked a series of questions."
"Anytime I hear a loud bang, or the slam of a door, or god forbid a dog, I can feel my blood pressure spike."
Do you people have any advice for me?
I'm only in my 20s I shouldn't be dealing with this.Please any support or hugs would really help-Wish I could just walk straight.
"I said, I’m a naturally more quiet person."
"In my teenage years I got pretty wild, and could pretty much do whatever I wanted without my dad questioning me why I was out all night or what I was doing."
"I thought it was only a short-term relief caused by alcohol, but I began to notice that anxiety did not disappear when start drinking beer or getting drunk, but only when I sobering up.I thought it was caused by alcohol, but when I drank other alcoholic beverages, the anxiety is still the same.I experimented and found that after drinking 3.4 glasses of beer I feel fresh and without anxiety (When I drink a lot of beer the next day I feel without anxiety but with a hangover and sadness - I think bcs worse quality of sleep)."
"I got rid of people who caused me stress, making my anxiety 100x worse, I started a degree, I’ve met someone."
"for example, i have a friend i really like and we talk all the time but suddenly it was so much harder in a group dynamic and i feel like i wasn’t being as good of a friend to them as i usually try to be."
Ugh.
Or if they just don’t respond at all I get worried.
I began to panic so I woke my brother up (it was about 2am) thinking I might need to go to the ER.
"Anyways, fast forward."
Has anyone here ever has vertigo before??
You know how anxiety and panic are the worst feelings in the world.
No cars blew at her or stopped she just stood there.
and apparently she would like to get her hysterectomy done as-well since she had it planned for a about a week or two from today.
"I feel like I’m gonna screw this up somehow.-A few days ago, my anxiety got the best of me and I went off on a friend while I was trying to conceal that I was having an attack."
This has TAUGHT your amygdala that the feeling of anxiety in itself is something dangerous that needs to be avoided!
Distractibility.
And it's pretty much all because of my college major.
I’m working tonight & I really don’t think I have the strength to pull myself together & face the world.
Colors become vivid.
Which is a feeling ive never felt because ive always been so worried about it.
"Beach days were my favourite, I felt happy and my symptoms subsided."
"The reason i didn't tell them is because i feared that they would judge me, and yell at me for not doing anything to stand up for myself, in fact my self-confidence was so bad that i was hanging out with my bullies."
"I’m determined to get better, one day at a time.-I'm new to this anxiety world and honestly it's been a roller coaster ride so far."
It’s probably also not smart to be on Ambien too.
Sit with it.
"For some reason it's one of those extremely hated things where I feel like I'm gonna throw up or stop breathing, like it's very bad."
it’s been so hard and i try so many things to help it and none of them have been working cause that’s how bad it’s been.
"I don’t think I’m depressed, I think that these negative thoughts loops are controlling my mood."
"She’s great, but I still feel impending doom."
"We booked the same restaurant and went to eat there....I had a lovely meal, didn't have any panic throughout and really enjoyed the experience."
"I’m in college, and I haven’t dated since I was 15."
it sounds ridiculous.
"So I suppress.I just wish, I would improve and some day, be “normal”."
"I'm also wondering if it might be a sensory processing issue, but I don't know much about that."
"Today, my mom started talking about it with me and she told me that I'm probably gonna go to therapy soon."
But due to the side effects of it I wanted to switch.
i kinda feel like i can’t breathe and i’m so shakey.
"However, even on days when I feel perfectly fine and like myself again, I’ll get slapped with a random bout of nausea and sometimes I end up gagging."
"I'm always nervous, always getting chest pains, always acting weird and scared, I've gone on meds, my friends convinced me to start therapy, I've had 3 anxiety attacks in the past week."
F*** you anxiety!-Hey all I’m a guy in my mid 20’s.
"To monitor my anxiety level has really been effective.-i turned 31 yesterday, and have been dealing with anxiety most of my life."
"I suffer from extreme anxiety, and more often than not, it’s been debilitating and impacting my way of life.I have started drinking 20-30mg CBD coffee and that has seemed to really help."
But what can I expect while taking it?
I need to ground myself.I’m going to take some time off work and try to focus on more productive activities instead of social media which are a drain on me.I would like to thank all of you.
It paralyzes me.-Hi guys I am currently super nervous because I am driving an hour away on the freeway to go to the neurologist for my agoraphobia and panic disorder.
"Then worrying about my parents getting sick, and my sisters getting sick."
It's a so intrusive thought and maybe i'll change my career but maybe I regret that too...
"Also is my anxiety in this case more mental or chemical imbalance based, in your opinion."
Do you have any advice?
"I don't know why this bothers me so much, it's never constant noise -usually just a couple times a day- I try to reassure myself that everyone makes noises, that it doesn't impact my life in hardly any way, and that my life will be the same regardless of whether or not I hear my neighbors.I know I'm extremely sensitive to sound, but I can't live my life with noise canceling headphones on and constantly worried about my neighbors' noises."
"I miss my parents, the comfort of my home, even though my office is in the same city as my house."
I also noticed that my heart rate seemed to be a bit high (minor palpitations).
I tried to reach out to him many times in the past and I am actively trying but he doesn't open up .
The only ever time I had a reaction like that was a few months ago when I got into an argument with my mom.
Did some research and came to the conclusion that It can happen due to normal stress.
i don’t even feel like a person i just feel like a shell that does whatever i can to make sure people like me and still somehow messes it up.
I find myself making progress in that I’m not so focused on the negative aspects of my life and am more solution focused.
"The last time I felt this bad was 8 years ago, so it's been extra awful."
"Never sick, making the clients happy."
I have been struggling with eye floaters and it’s crazy because I got them two years ago and learned to ignore them and now they are back and feel worse than ever.
I can’t sleep for more than like 15 minutes at a time.
"The air crackles with possibilities!” “Oh, good lord…”Bojack slowly drowns himself in the tub…This is a very familiar dialogue for people with anxiety and overthinking."
"No symptoms before tonight however, and it has gotten worse since then further scaring me."
"Summoned in a healthy dose, fear will give you the swift edge you need in the short term and the dedicated motivation in the long run."
"As someone who struggles with off balance/dizziness(don’t know the exact cause,but doctors say it might be stress related) I’m kinda scared it’ll make it worse."
"But it’s getting warmer and I’d like to be more comfortable just being shirtless at home, or after a run or workout or whatever."
"My anxiety has always been bad, but it’s heightened in these kind of situations."
I’m 32 and Gay and new to the area and I want to meet more gay people and have more friends.
Any advice or free treatment options would be greatly appreciated.-I’ve been on low dose lorazepam since 2007.
Looking to go on tablets tomorrow so hopefully it’ll get better and i also start my CBT soon too.
The silent killer.”Our brains are wired to constantly look out for negatives.
"I feel horrible, I don't know what to do but I know for a fact that I can't go on like this."
Just really needed to vent this out into world.
It’s becoming so unbearable I can’t handle it anymore.
I began to hyperventilate and ran into my room.
"Instead, accept."
I’m a 27F who’s had a terrible time since April of this year and I feel defeated.
I tried opening up to someone but unfortunately it was shrugged off.
I'm so scared I'm going to get food poisoning that I actually tried to make myself sick earlier.

I have no motivation for anything left in me.
I get very anxious when I'm alone in the office.
"I cook for myself mostly, but that seems to make the fear a lot worse."
"When feeling incapable of handling the situation, we become anxious."
I’m seeing my doctor in 2 weeks when face to face dr appointments start again for the pill(country in lockdown).
"They’re not the type to forgive easily and I didn’t expect them to forgive me but it still hurt for some reason.-I have a gad and frequently have headaches in isolated points on my head (back right and front left usually) and while I know this could be due solely to stress, exhaustion, hunger, etc."
I also had excessive thirst and I am peeing every 5 mins for some weird reason.-I have the nagging sense that I might have to ask an old employer for something.
"I don't think there is objectively anything wrong with me but then within minutes when I start dressing up my brain just switches into ""You are ugly."
I’m 31 now and my entire 20s flew by and I didn’t get to enjoy them at all.
Last week asked me if I could come in on Sunday and I said sure.
Somedays I feel like I am an invisible void in the earth.
And what if it had rabies?
and i don’t regret it.
I'm a mess right now.
I feel bad bringing this up to people in my life because I feel like I’m bothering them and have nothing to complain about since I live a pretty privileged life and stuff.
Dont feel like I can do it2.
"As we pull up to the light, I notice the same woman who was behind me standing at the cross walk on the other side of the street, but she was just standing there on the curb."
"No, never, I can never trust."
My immediate response is to leave them and escape.-I really enjoy taking pre workout but I can’t handle the amount of anxiety that the caffeine gives me after.
Some days are better than others but I’m really starting to get sick of the fear because it’s almost unbearable and quite frankly just annoying.
"Once I realized I was able to head home from that situation, I naturally started to feel a bit better."
All I have are regrets.
I cannot do it any longer.
"I don't know if I've ever really tried as a result as I tend to just abandon things/rationalize not pursuing then further, even though I worry about and desire to achieve something so much."
Everytime I quit xanax 2-3 days later I get this weird insomnia but it goes away in a few days nothing too serious.
Did it make anyone else feel pretty good?
Do you please have any tips on how to find strength to make this conversation?-Does anyone else get these bizarre and brief head rushes like a vertigo feeling with their anxiety?I’ve gotten these a few times over the past few years where I’ll be doing anything like standing doing nothing or working on my computer and get these weird head rush feelings that last a few seconds then go away.
"I def reccomend finding a little trinket you can fidget with to carry with you throughout your day, it helped me a lot and I'm glad I found this :) hope it helps someone else-Basically its been almost 4 weeks since we have been back in school since the summer holidays and I have hardly done any of the work for one of my subjects and I barely know the teachers so I'm really anxious and nervous to go up to them and tell them  my reasons.And I really don't want to get kicked out of the 6th form I go to for not completing my work.So I'm thinking of telling my problems to this other perosn who is not a teacher of mine for that subject but he is like the assistant head of house  for the 6th form I  go to and I've had him as a teacher before so I'm more comfortable telling him my problems.Basically my reason for not doing the work is bascially a close family member of mine who I loved  very much died during the holidays and I thought that I could just go back to school and do my work and just be like I was before the holidays and before this family member died but it as turned out to be harder than I thought going back to school acting like nothing happened or acting like I'm fine or that I can still do my work.And I also have some other personal problems that have affected me and my capabilities in doing my work but that family member dying is one if the biggest things that have affected my work quality.Idk."
Should I tell her explicitly that I want medication?
the hundreds and hundreds of google searches and Reddit searches have only made my feelings worse.
"Thankfully this fear doesn’t stop me from living my life, but it does absolutely scare me and raises my anxiety through the roof when I actually let myself sit and think about it."
Thank you so much in advance!-Just here to complain.
"I already feel quite nervous, and I don’t want to be shaking and freaking out the whole time I’m there."
